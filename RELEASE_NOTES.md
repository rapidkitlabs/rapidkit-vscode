# Release Notes

## v0.47.1 (September 7, 2026)

### Deterministic startup and workspace synchronization

Workspai for VS Code 0.47.1 is validated against Workspai CLI 0.75.0. This
stability patch makes webview readiness, workspace selection, project loading,
and Dashboard synchronization deterministic without restoring blocking startup
work.

Highlights:

- Workspace selection commits synchronously to one internal event before VS
  Code context keys, persistence, evidence, or Dashboard hydration run.
- Projects, modules, Workspace Health, Contract Graph, both sidebars, and the
  Dashboard now project from the same committed workspace and project scope.
- Dashboard, Quick Actions, and the secondary sidebar install message receivers
  before loading HTML and replay current state after an explicit ready handshake.
- Workspace-truth, catalog, and environment-probe bootstrap lanes are
  independent, so one stalled operation cannot prevent another section from
  hydrating.
- Late project scans and Dashboard evidence from superseded selections are
  discarded through generation and path guards.
- Project selection has one tree ingress and is committed before both sidebars
  refresh their scope.
- Active-workspace watcher scoping, atomic workspace registry writes, and
  file-backed Studio session persistence reduce startup and Linux inotify
  pressure.
- Activation timing telemetry distinguishes Workspai work from a blocked shared
  VS Code Extension Host.

Compatibility:

- VS Code 1.106.0+
- Workspai CLI 0.75.0+
- Git for remote repository analysis
- RapidKit Core 0.6.0 only for Python-backed kits/modules

## v0.47.0 (September 6, 2026)

### Local repository intelligence before the first agent change

Workspai for VS Code 0.47.0 is validated against Workspai CLI 0.75.0. This
release adds a local-first Analyze Repo experience and aligns every mirrored
contract and the bundled runtime with the CLI's reliable polyglot intelligence
and bounded agent-context release.

Highlights:

- Create now starts with a product category instead of one growing flat list.
  The new AI Agent lane exposes release-admitted Microsoft Agent Framework
  Python and .NET kits with exact runtime profiles, governed ownership, bounded
  agent context, and CLI verification.
- Primary-sidebar creation, Dashboard starters, the secondary Create tab, AI
  Create, and Studio grounding now share the CLI-authored executable kit
  contract. Studio recognizes governed agent projects as agent runtimes rather
  than treating them as generic web services.
- Analysis recording now captures the actual themed panel at observed stages and
  tours the rendered results. Recorded GIFs are separate from illustrated summaries.
- Shared Graph rendering keeps node sprites visible through transparent edges;
  export runs on a separate canvas. Unverified remote execution and missing
  vulnerability audits remain explicitly unverified in the report.
- Paste a public GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket repository URL and receive a
  minimal evidence-backed report without running repository code or installing
  project dependencies.
- Analysis uses a shallow isolated clone, an isolated Workspai registry, the
  canonical Model and Knowledge Graph, the complete intelligence chain, and a
  bounded Graph retrieval benchmark.
- Repository identity, project/entity/relation/proof totals, agent readiness,
  high-connection architecture surfaces, and retrieval reduction are projected
  from CLI artifacts instead of inferred UI scores.
- The result experience embeds the production 3D Graph renderer, canonical
  Doctor findings and quality coverage, plus locally encoded Analysis Story and
  360° Graph GIF exports.
- The Graph opens as a full-width, architecture-first explorer instead of an
  unfiltered node cloud. Decision panels explain Web/remote-agent fit, observed
  security signals, verification and delivery controls, and high-reach change
  surfaces without inventing a quality score. The guided Story GIF includes the
  live rendered Graph and focused result scenes.
- Local evidence is cached by normalized repository, remote commit, and
  verified CLI version. The operator can open the isolated source, inspect
  canonical artifacts, or delete the local analysis.
- Node/TypeScript retrieval, nested polyglot topology, explicit external scope,
  Agent Framework admission, and bounded Project Agent Context behavior consume
  Workspai CLI 0.75.0 truth.
- The extension bundles the integrity-checked Workspai CLI 0.75.0 runtime and
  mirrors its complete published contract catalog and command inventory.
- Review Changes combines the local working-tree diff with CLI-authored impact,
  freshness, verification recommendations, searchable changed paths, and a
  copyable agent handoff without running project scripts automatically.
- Dashboard is now the first primary tab. Analyze Repo and Review Changes use a
  clearer action hierarchy, evidence labels, scope guidance, and keyboard focus
  treatment across their enterprise-facing surfaces.

Compatibility:

- VS Code 1.106.0+
- Workspai CLI 0.75.0+
- Git for remote repository analysis
- RapidKit Core 0.6.0 only for Python-backed kits/modules

## v0.46.0 (September 1, 2026)

### Proof-carrying Studio and live operational assurance

Workspai for VS Code 0.46.0 is validated against Workspai CLI 0.72.0. This
release connects Agent and Goal source operations to the CLI-owned
Proof-Carrying Change lifecycle while keeping Ask and Plan read-only. It also
brings Live, measurable retrieval efficiency, project Graph presentation, and
bounded project-native command execution onto the current CLI contracts.

Highlights:

- Agent, Goal, autonomous blocker repair, and native Chat establish or resume
  an immutable Goal Pack before mutation and discover the existing open change
  through the canonical `change list` projection.
- Source repairs and structured project commands enter one CLI-owned PCC flow:
  pinned baseline, bounded authorization, typed effect receipt, fresh Graph
  re-observation, strict independent verification, and sealed capsule. Read-only
  commands remain Live observations, proven rollbacks do not become fake
  effects, and non-reversible Git or external effects require an exact one-run
  approval plus successful post-effect observation before completion.
- Deleted files carry CLI-derived deletion tombstones, and a recreated path
  invalidates the capsule. Blocked or awaiting-human PCC ledgers can resume only
  after an uncached human decision; history is never replaced or forked.
- Linked-project source receipts use the workspace contract's portable
  `external/<project>` identity instead of leaking or trusting absolute paths.
- Studio keeps exact command approval, serialized execution, complete source
  checkpoints, rollback, language intelligence, concurrent reads, and durable
  causal memory while PCC adds tamper-evident change assurance.
- Exact Agent approvals now render as compact, fingerprint-bound cards inside
  the Studio conversation with run-once, session, project, and decline scopes;
  the native VS Code modal remains only as a non-webview fallback.
- Fresh CLI remediation plans now become durable exact-action continuations:
  the model receives only the selected immutable `stepId`, approval-required
  actions pause before execution, and a reload resumes the same fingerprinted
  boundary. Only a real failed execution widens back to general causal repair.
- CLI 0.72 runtime prerequisites remain typed through Studio and native Chat.
  The extension scopes the workspace-wide `nextActionId` to the active finding,
  shows missing executables as environment setup instead of a completed repair,
  and never retries a blocked action in the same evidence generation. When no
  exact CLI action or external prerequisite applies, the model retains the
  governed discovery, search, inspection, command, and source-repair plane.
- Goal preflight now follows the CLI-authored canonical freshness recovery once:
  a `live-input-mismatch` triggers one visible `--refresh` retry before the
  immutable Goal is activated, while unrelated failures remain fail-closed.
- Dashboard Live includes an Operations Floor plus focused Operations, Change
  Assurance, and Command Center views. The Floor correlates Board v1 stages,
  Studio tool attempts, benchmark provenance, the bounded canonical Graph, and
  PCC overlays without inventing architecture links from activity. Capsule,
  lease, prediction, actual Graph delta, surprise report, transaction, and event
  artifacts open through the governed evidence bridge.
- Graph can overlay predicted operations, the actual architecture delta, and
  unpredicted surprises on the canonical project Graph without rewriting its
  entities or relationships. Live and Graph refresh while visible so the model,
  operator, and presentation surfaces converge on the same current evidence.
- Graph presentation can arrange real entities and relationships into the
  selected project's name, shorten display-only labels, and export the result
  without mutating canonical Graph records.
- The extension bundles the integrity-checked Workspai CLI 0.72.0 runtime and
  mirrors its published contracts and command inventory from the npm authority.

Compatibility:

- VS Code 1.106.0+
- Workspai CLI 0.72.0+
- RapidKit Core 0.6.0 only for Python-backed kits/modules

## v0.45.0 (August 28, 2026)

### Portable project intelligence and evidence-driven agent operations

Workspai for VS Code 0.45.0 is validated against Workspai CLI 0.67.0. This
release carries the CLI's project-owned Graph, evidence-selected Skills, and
dual-era intelligence contracts into the extension without creating a second
source of architectural truth.

Highlights:

- Adopted projects validate their portable agent entry, readiness dimensions,
  and project Graph reference before Agent may use them for grounded work.
- Dashboard and Graph surfaces expose exact inventory completeness, provider
  coverage and budgets, API runtime bindings, project governance, project
  scope, and entity-kind search filters.
- A deterministic Project name projection turns the selected project's real
  Graph entities into its Unicode-aware wordmark for interactive presentation,
  GIF, and MP4 export without adding synthetic entities or relationships.
  Canvas labels remove redundant project/kind prose while canonical labels stay
  intact for search, evidence, details, and agent consumers.
- Artifacts, Studio, Assistant, and Copilot resolve project-owned Graph/context
  files from the selected project's root and expose them as independent,
  clickable contract-backed outputs.
- Bounded CLI activity journals appear in Recent Commands while Live combines
  the CLI-owned Board v1 projection with every durable Studio tool call in a
  continuously refreshed vertical timeline and evidence-aware Command Center.
  Typed artifact/Graph/proof bindings form a visible provenance bridge; Graph
  edges are overlaid only when the exact source revision is declared, and
  Studio Graph-query stages retain the entity/relation/proof IDs consumed by
  the model.
- Agent retrieval benchmarks preserve estimated/measured provenance, while
  evaluation detail exposes token sources, latency, cost, repeated reads,
  no-progress decisions, and verification-backed outcomes.
- Skill selection decisions, structured MCP runtime capabilities, and repair
  qualification matrices are schema-checked while older compatible artifacts
  remain readable.
- Workspace contract sync, planned/runtime-aware workspace execution, and the
  CLI-owned live activity graph are available through governed extension
  commands.
- The extension bundles the integrity-checked Workspai CLI 0.67.0 runtime and
  synchronizes its published contracts and command surface from that authority.
- Agent and Goal now request genuinely blocking user input through an explicit
  pre-mutation protocol, provider-bound cancellation releases sessions
  immediately, and completed Plans carry their inspected output into the
  user-approved **Run with Agent** handoff.
- Studio now supports exact once, session, and project approval for
  project-native invasive commands. Every scope remains bound to executable,
  arguments, working directory, purpose, timeout, and immutable fingerprint;
  saved approvals expire and can be revoked from the Command Palette. Changed
  proposals require new approval, while shell execution, privilege escalation,
  secret forwarding, Workspai CLI bypasses, and workspace escapes remain
  non-approvable.
- Exact Git-metadata and external registry, cluster, daemon, or remote actions
  use a one-run approval only. Their non-source rollback boundary is explicit
  in the durable receipt. Machine-readable effect domains prevent completion
  until successful read-only commands observe every matching system domain.
- Project-native commands run inside a serialized source transaction. Studio
  creates a byte-complete private checkpoint, reports process lifecycle into
  Live, restores undeclared mutations automatically, and rolls back partial
  source changes from failed approved commands before the model continues.
- Graph-bounded reasoning now composes with VS Code language intelligence for
  definitions, references, implementations, hover types, document symbols,
  and workspace symbols. Up to eight independent read-only inspections can run
  concurrently with deterministic result order; writes remain serialized.
- Long Studio sessions retain a deterministic causal spine after older events
  leave the raw prompt window. Sequence-bound failure, verification, steering,
  checkpoint, and per-tool outcome summaries preserve recovery state without
  replaying source bodies or trusting a model-authored memory summary.
- Linked projects participate through canonical Model identity instead of
  directory ancestry. The model can select arbitrary project-native causal
  commands through a bounded no-shell executor, while source fingerprints and
  automatic canonical verification remain controller-owned; missing system
  toolchains remain explicit operator prerequisites.

Compatibility:

- VS Code 1.106.0+
- Workspai CLI 0.67.0+
- RapidKit Core 0.6.0 only for Python-backed kits/modules

## v0.44.0 (August 23, 2026)

### Governed repair convergence and immersive workspace graph

Workspai for VS Code 0.44.0 is validated against Workspai CLI 0.64.0. This
release closes the repair loop around canonical CLI producers and turns the
proof-backed Workspace Graph into a live, explorable, presentation-ready 3D
surface.

Highlights:

- Missing or stale lifecycle evidence is routed to the exact project-scoped
  Workspai producer before Verify continues. Workspai commands use the bundled
  governed command registry; project-native tools remain separately bounded.
- Studio source fingerprints exclude generated evidence and dependency output,
  so autonomous diagnostics remain safe in new repositories and workspaces
  without an initial Git commit.
- Dashboard cards and Studio consume validated, coalesced graph generations and
  reject corrupt, incomplete, stale, or cross-scope stream updates.
- The Graph opens in 3D with persistent three-axis orbit, automatic motion, and
  deterministic Architecture, Globe, Brain, Constellation, and Workspai
  projections over the same canonical entities and relationships.
- The Workspai projection follows the official logo geometry, while Brain and
  Constellation use readable semantic layouts instead of decorative random
  placement.
- Governed export supports adaptive-palette GIF and high-quality H.264 MP4 with
  user-selected pace, full multi-angle coverage, dashboard-matched framing, and
  the selected graph projection.
- Dense Graph controls and evidence detail are compacted so the interactive
  visualization remains visible near the top of the dashboard.

Compatibility:

- VS Code 1.106.0+
- Workspai CLI 0.64.0+
- RapidKit Core 0.6.0 only for Python-backed kits/modules

## v0.43.0 (August 22, 2026)

### Conversational Create and embedded CLI authority

Workspai for VS Code 0.43.0 is validated against Workspai CLI 0.64.0. This
release gives the Create experience one model-guided but controller-governed
path and makes the packaged CLI the consistent authority for extension
operations from the first run.

Highlights:

- Create distinguishes conversation, clarification, architecture guidance,
  adoption, existing-source work, and high-confidence creation intent before it
  can propose or execute a scaffold plan.
- The model consumes the CLI-published profile and kit contract, while one
  controller-owned capability executes approved workspace, project, companion,
  and intelligence operations.
- Workspace plans remain stable while sidebar context refreshes. Project plans
  are bound to the active workspace selected by the user and cannot silently
  fall back to a different or default workspace.
- The plan card now names its real mutation target: either a new workspace and
  first project, or a new project in the active selected workspace.
- The extension embeds an integrity-checked Workspai CLI 0.64.0 runtime, so
  Create, Doctor, Graph, Goal, Agent, and Dashboard do not depend on a global
  installation or a mutable `npx` cache.
- Python-engine setup is derived from the approved project plan and returns
  runtime-specific, actionable diagnostics without coupling Node-only or
  polyglot workspaces to Python bootstrap.
- Create and lifecycle commands share one verified CLI capability surface, so a
  command that successfully creates a workspace is not rejected by a conflicting
  secondary capability check.
- Integrated terminals now show normal `workspai ...` commands while remaining
  bound to the same CLI embedded in the extension.
- Repair cards now show concise causes, avoid duplicate explanatory artifacts,
  and refresh the CLI-authored causal evidence queue before a model is asked to
  diagnose or change source.
- Dashboard and Artifacts now rebuild one complete canonical snapshot whenever
  CLI or Studio evidence changes, including linked-project artifacts and
  explicit missing states.

Compatibility:

- VS Code 1.106.0+
- Workspai CLI 0.64.0+
- RapidKit Core 0.6.0 only for Python-backed kits/modules

## v0.42.0 (August 21, 2026)

### Intent-aware modes, causal repair queues, and native change review

Workspai for VS Code 0.42.0 is validated against Workspai CLI 0.63.0. This
release makes Assistant mode selection intent-aware without silently escalating
authority, gives aggregate workspace cards a deterministic causal repair queue,
and turns agent changes into a native, transaction-bound review experience.

Highlights:

- Agent, Ask, Plan, and Goal now share one model-driven intent classification
  and immutable execution policy. Read-only authority may be reduced
  automatically; stronger mutation or durable Goal authority always requires an
  explicit user action.
- Aggregate Doctor, Analyze, Readiness, Verify, Run, and Intelligence cards are
  decomposed into one causal finding family and one canonical project per repair
  transaction, then advanced using freshly produced CLI evidence.
- Sidebar Studio, native Chat, and card handoff share governed patch, deletion,
  command, verification, rollback, and project-boundary controls.
- Every completed change set has authoritative line totals, a compact file
  summary, native multi-file Review, checkpoint-backed before/after diffs, and
  transaction-bound Undo.
- Agent context follows the CLI-authored bounded order: evidence index, active
  Goal, relevant context and Skills, then proof-backed Graph retrieval. Full
  model and graph exports stay outside ordinary prompts.
- CLI 0.63.0 contract alignment covers causal finding targets, sequential
  aggregate repair, canonical project entry, Skills, and agent context.

Compatibility:

- VS Code 1.106.0+
- Workspai CLI 0.63.0+
- RapidKit Core 0.6.0 only for Python-backed kits/modules

## v0.41.0 (August 19, 2026)

### Intelligent Agent Preflight and Enriched Repair Loop

Workspai for VS Code 0.41.0 is validated against Workspai CLI 0.61.0. This
release makes free-form agent sessions intent-aware, adds a replan decision
to the repair loop, enriches the workspace context consumed by all agent modes,
and applies a minimal, enterprise-level visual redesign to the chat experience.

The extension continues to consume the CLI's published schemas, capability
inventory, repair transaction, and verification artifacts. Missing, stale,
incompatible, or unsafe evidence blocks the relevant operation with an
actionable explanation.

Highlights:

- Free-form agent sessions run a preflight turn without tools to determine
  whether the user request is clear engineering intent before executing workspace
  inspection and repair tools.
- Replan adds a safe retry option that discards the current failed plan for the
  same repair target without forcing a full cancel and restart.
- WorkspaceAgentContext is enriched with impact, doctor, analyze, readiness,
  verify, explain, and diff summaries so agents read one file instead of many.
- Chat UI follows professional minimal enterprise conventions for typography,
  spacing, empty states, and error displays.
- CLI 0.61.0 contract alignment across repair transaction, repair capabilities,
  and extension-cli compatibility.

Compatibility:

- VS Code 1.106.0+
- Workspai CLI 0.61.0+
- RapidKit Core 0.6.0 only for Python-backed kits/modules

## v0.40.0 (August 18, 2026)

### Governed Goals, canonical agent entry, and verified source repair

Workspai for VS Code 0.40.0 is verified against Workspai CLI 0.60.0 and turns Goal,
Agent, native Chat, and Incident Studio into consumers of the same canonical
entry, evidence, repair, and verification contracts.

Highlights:

- Goal is a first-class Assistant mode for arbitrary bounded engineering
  outcomes, backed by CLI-authored Goal Packs, durable attempt budgets, and
  evidence-aware completion.
- Goal scope follows the selected project automatically; multi-project
  workspaces offer one project, a project set, or the full workspace without
  making the model guess.
- Polyglot coverage Goals select only canonical runtimes supplied by the CLI,
  and incompatible project sets stop before mutation.
- Adopted projects must pass the portable project-entry and agent-bootstrap
  contract before broad discovery or mutation.
- Sidebar and native Chat share one project-bound repair controller, bounded
  source tools, CLI-owned patch transactions, rollback, and exact verification.
- Linked-project scope, changed-file review, and durable replay remain bound to
  the selected canonical project rather than only the enclosing workspace.
- Machine-local workspace, project, checkpoint, and proof paths are redacted
  before they reach models, Webviews, conversation history, or release assets.
- English-only and local-path guards protect source, tests, documentation,
  packaging, pre-commit, and CI surfaces.

Compatibility:

- VS Code 1.106.0+
- Workspai CLI 0.60.0+
- RapidKit Core 0.6.0 only for Python-backed kits/modules

## v0.39.0 (August 11, 2026)

### Canonical Doctor, polyglot graph intelligence, and grounded repair

This release validates Workspai for VS Code against CLI 0.56.0 and expands the
IDE from a compact graph renderer into a privacy-bounded consumer of the full
Workspace Intelligence contract. Doctor, Dashboard, Assistant, Studio, and the
Graph Explorer now share canonical artifacts, freshness, scope, and repair
identifiers instead of maintaining separate UI interpretations.

Highlights:

- `@workspai /repair` now runs the governed CLI Repair Engine inside VS Code's
  native Chat surface and renders progress, verified receipts, and explicit
  transaction decisions without opening a second repair dashboard.
- When deterministic repair identifies a typed source-repair boundary, native
  Chat continues through the same durable Studio model/tool loop used by the
  extension, streams tool activity, and accepts source changes only through a
  closed CLI patch transaction.
- Doctor cards consume canonical diagnosis, summary, capability, validation,
  receipt, freshness, applicability, and repair-disposition fields.
- The Graph Explorer exposes language coverage, runtime topology, providers,
  semantic bindings, source scopes, diagnostics, and detailed proof metadata.
- Architecture-balanced graph sampling preserves services, APIs, schemas,
  runtimes, packages, pipelines, tests, deployments, and owners in bounded
  Webview payloads.
- Proof paths are converted to portable workspace-relative identities before
  crossing the Extension Host/Webview boundary; local user paths stay hidden.
- Ask, Plan, Agent, Dashboard, and Studio use one CLI-authored artifact catalog
  and explicit evidence freshness objective.
- Studio blocker handoff uses stable finding, causal, capability, scope, and
  verification identifiers, with canonical CLI actions for repair.
- Project-scoped module capabilities are no longer rejected as missing
  top-level commands.
- The analytics permission prompt and settings have been removed. Retention
  analytics remain hard-disabled; local Dashboard and Incident Studio evidence
  continues to operate without an outbound analytics transport.
- Every Workspace row in the primary sidebar now exposes a terminal icon that
  opens an integrated terminal rooted at that exact Workspace.
- Studio no longer presents rolled-back repairs as actionable decisions. Real
  CLI decision gates now remain bound to their transaction and render inline in
  the repair conversation instead of becoming a disconnected control.
- A verified selected repair now closes the Studio phase rail at `11/11` even
  when unrelated workspace findings remain. Restored checkpoints are labeled
  as restored, and internal policy stops cannot manufacture review buttons.
- The cross-platform release stop gate now tolerates bounded transient GitHub
  transport failures while still failing closed for permission errors or an
  exhausted retry budget.
- `RUN_ONCE` missing-evidence recovery now enters the CLI Repair Engine instead
  of a legacy inline-command lane, and no-shell Agent commands retain bounded
  stdout/stderr reliably when invoking Node.js tools.
- Incident Studio now follows a conversation-first hierarchy: workspace and
  blocker context stay compact, completed activity collapses into a worked-step
  summary, and the current CLI action remains beside the conversation.

Compatibility:

- VS Code 1.106.0+
- Workspai CLI 0.56.0+
- RapidKit Core 0.6.0 only for Python-backed kits/modules

Release posture: `canonical-intelligence-consumer-and-private-graph-evidence`

## v0.38.0 (August 8, 2026)

### Truthful evidence, typed repair decisions, and a calmer Dashboard

This release aligns Workspai for VS Code with CLI 0.55.1. Dashboard posture is
now taken from explicit CLI evidence, Studio routes non-closed repairs through
typed decision causes, and selected-workspace artifacts refresh while they
change—even when the workspace lives outside the open VS Code folder.

Highlights:

- Evidence cards resolve to **Healthy**, **Needs attention**, or **Blocked**
  without turning advisory or stale evidence into a false release blocker.
- Workspace Explain consumes canonical verdict, freshness, and blocking fields
  from CLI 0.55.1 instead of inferring release posture from risk prose.
- Studio consumes typed repair-decision causes for missing executables,
  unsupported adapters, failed preconditions, policy decisions, and source
  repair requirements.
- Repeated controller-owned evidence commands are bounded and consolidated
  instead of filling the repair timeline with identical failed attempts.
- Changed files have a dedicated review surface with bounded previews and an
  exact VS Code before/after diff when a transaction checkpoint is available.
- Dashboard evidence watches both the open editor folders and the explicitly
  selected managed workspace, so cards update from their canonical artifacts.
- The Library publishes the complete example catalog, including runnable
  examples and released workspace-profile foundations across supported
  runtimes, while Recent Workspaces stays on Home.
- Dashboard and Studio use a quieter enterprise-minimal hierarchy, compact
  state icons, and clearer action/result separation.

Compatibility:

- VS Code 1.106.0+
- Workspai CLI 0.55.1+
- RapidKit Core 0.6.0 only for Python-backed kits/modules

Release posture: `truthful-evidence-and-typed-repair-decisions`

## v0.37.0 (August 7, 2026)

### Governed, target-aware repair with live change review

This release aligns Workspai for VS Code with CLI 0.55.0. The CLI owns blocker
mutation, reconciliation, rollback, and canonical verification; Studio owns
scope, model interaction, progress, diffs, and explicit user decisions.

Highlights:

- Durable CLI Repair Engine transactions replace the competing extension-side
  repair executor.
- Missing dependency trees can complete without requiring an artificial source
  edit, and unrelated workspace blockers no longer invalidate the target fix.
- Linked projects and registry aliases use the canonical project name from
  blocker evidence instead of relying on a directory-name guess.
- Every Dashboard blocker maps to an exact producer, artifact, scope, repair
  capability, and Stop Gate.
- Studio shows commands, changed files, and bounded unified diffs while repair
  is running.
- Native model tool calls retain provider identity and causal observations
  across reload and resume.
- Primary sidebar actions are grouped around frequent user tasks without
  removing advanced workspace/project commands.
- Workspai CLI is the only universal Setup requirement; RapidKit Core remains
  workspace-local and optional.

Compatibility:

- VS Code 1.106.0+
- Workspai CLI 0.55.0+
- RapidKit Core 0.6.0 only for Python-backed kits/modules

## v0.36.0 (August 3, 2026)

### Reliable sessions and first-install-safe creation

This release aligns Workspai for VS Code with CLI 0.52.3 and makes ownership of
Studio and Create operations explicit across reloads, failures, and fresh
machines.

Highlights:

- Studio no longer treats persisted repair history as proof that a provider
  process is still running.
- Interrupted Create sessions become truthful, removable stopped records.
- Creating the first project can safely establish
  `~/.workspai/workspaces/workspai` even when no Workspai directories exist.
- The default managed workspace is runtime-neutral and does not install the
  optional Python engine.
- CLI discovery recognizes global npm and common Node version managers without
  contacting the registry during activation.
- Dependency remediation retains guarded, project-native resolution paths when
  no safe automatic fix exists.

Compatibility:

Release posture: `session-ownership-and-first-install-reliability`

## v0.35.0 (August 2, 2026)

### Workspace Intelligence, verified goals, and dependable Studio repair

This release aligns Workspai for VS Code with CLI 0.52.0 across the primary
sidebar, Dashboard, Create, Setup, and Assistant.

Highlights:

- Dashboard sections are Home, Run, Repair, Artifacts, Graph, Project, and
  Library, with truthful missing/stale evidence states.
- Create supports the complete canonical backend, frontend, desktop, and
  extension kit catalog plus explicit adopt/import flows.
- Ask, Plan, and Agent share the selected workspace/project scope.
- Agent accepts ordinary engineering goals as well as blocker cards.
- Verified goals cover release preparation, non-breaking dependency repair, and
  test-coverage targets.
- Studio requires real source change evidence, closes dependency transactions,
  refreshes the governed Workspace Intelligence loop, and accepts completion
  only from fresh non-blocking verification.
- CLI-authored Doctor strategy, typed repair operations, and verification
  commands reach Studio without being dropped.
- Project Explorer recognizes current Rust, PHP, desktop, and extension kits.
- Setup discovers global and version-manager CLI installations and keeps
  RapidKit Core optional for non-Python workspaces.
- Recovery-mode creation uses the canonical `.workspai-workspace` marker and
  an honest synchronization guide.

Compatibility:

- VS Code 1.106.0+
- Workspai CLI 0.52.0+
- RapidKit Core 0.6.0 only for Python-backed kits/modules

Validation:

- 356 test files passed
- 2510 tests passed; 2 skipped
- CLI/extension contract parity passed
- 172 palette commands synchronized
- TypeScript host/webview checks passed
- Production build passed

- **Foundation Ensure** sits in Run & Release and dispatches `workspace foundation ensure [--force]` with modal guardrails.
- Project tree now includes build, production start, lint, and format commands aligned with npm lifecycle adapters.
- **Module Maintenance** submenu reads installed modules from `registry.json`, supports dry-run previews, and requires confirmation before upgrade/rollback/uninstall.
- Added focused vitest suites asserting exact terminal command arrays for all new surfaces.

Validation:

- `npm run compile`
- `npm run lint`
- `vitest run`

Release posture: `cli-parity-and-workspace-command-surface`

## v0.33.0 (June 8, 2026)

### ✦ .NET Setup Runtime and Enterprise Profile Parity

Summary:

- Promote the extension release to `0.33.0` because `0.32.1` was pushed but not published to the marketplace.
- Complete `.NET` runtime setup coverage across the VS Code command palette and dashboard setup experience.
- Add `dotnet-only` profile parity across schemas, completions, hover help, AI creation, command reference, and workspace creation UI.
- Harden subprocess-based release gate tests and RapidKit CLI fallback tests so CI remains deterministic across operating systems.

Highlights:

- Setup Runtime now includes `.NET` alongside Python, Node.js, Go, and Java.
- The setup dashboard can detect, verify, and guide installation for `.NET SDK 8+`.
- Workspace bootstrap profiles now include `dotnet-only`, and polyglot/enterprise copy clearly includes `.NET`.
- Extension metadata now advertises `.NET Web API` and C# support for marketplace discovery.
- Drift guards now protect `.NET` and profile parity from silently regressing.

Validation:

- `./node_modules/.bin/tsc --noEmit`

Release posture: `runtime-profile-parity-and-extension-stabilization`

## v0.32.1 (June 8, 2026)

### ✦ Runtime Command Surface Parity and Module Boundary Hardening

Summary:

- Align the Workspai extension with RapidKit npm `0.32.1` command contracts.
- Add a shared runtime command surface contract so scaffold kits, lifecycle commands, runtime tiers, and module-support boundaries cannot drift silently.
- Restrict AI module suggestions to FastAPI and NestJS, while clearly guiding Go, Spring Boot, and .NET users toward their native package ecosystems.
- Update dashboard, setup, command reference, module browser, module details, and AI creation surfaces to the pinned npm wrapper form.

Highlights:

- Extension-host calls now use `npx --yes --package rapidkit rapidkit ...` instead of relying on ambiguous local/global command resolution.
- FastAPI and NestJS remain module-capable; Go, Spring Boot, and .NET are scaffold/import/runtime-supported but do not expose RapidKit module marketplace suggestions.
- `.NET` AI creation copy now correctly explains NuGet/native adapter extension paths instead of reusing Spring Boot module text.
- Studio and README command snippets now use current `doctor workspace/project` scopes and pinned npm commands.
- Runtime parity tests cover scaffold kit exposure, AI module suggestion boundaries, command snippets, and npm wrapper usage.

Validation:

- `npm run typecheck`
- `npm run check:parity-snapshot`
- `vitest run src/test/runtimeCommandSurfaceParity.test.ts src/test/driftGuard.test.ts src/test/platformCapabilities.test.ts src/test/springSupportContracts.test.ts src/test/aiService.test.ts`
- `npm run lint:stabilization`
- `npm run build`
- `git diff --check`

Release posture: `contract-parity-and-extension-stabilization`

## v0.32.0 (June 2, 2026)

### ✦ Enterprise Workspai Dashboard and Workspace Contract Release

Summary:

- Redesign core workspace, project, module install, module details, and AI creation modals with a consistent enterprise modal system.
- Refresh README and media documentation with the new dashboard, modal, module, and contract registry screenshots.

Highlights:

- Dashboard now separates workspace operations, project build actions, share/handoff actions, recent workspaces, templates, and module browsing with clearer scope boundaries.
- Project actions now focus on project-level operations and avoid showing workspace-local absolute paths in user-facing module surfaces.
- Added resilient webview error handling to prevent blank dashboard failures from hiding actionable recovery paths.
- Added updated screenshot set including `workspai-screenshot-9.png` for the Workspace Contract Registry documentation.
- Cleared npm audit findings with safe dependency updates and targeted transitive overrides for vulnerable test-cli dependencies.

Validation:

- `./node_modules/.bin/tsc --noEmit` passed during the release preparation window.
- `node esbuild.js` passed in `webview-ui`.
- `npm audit --json` reports 0 vulnerabilities.
- `git diff --check` passed.

## v0.31.0 (May 31, 2026)

## v0.29.1 (May 23, 2026)

### ✦ Consolidated Stabilization & Feature Consolidation Release

Summary:

- This release consolidates a broad set of important stabilization, safety, and integration changes applied since `v0.29.0`. These are not "minor" editorial tweaks — they are deliberate stabilizations, safeguards, contract hardenings, and host/webview integrations that materially improve AI behavior, reliability, and governance.
- Notable surface areas include AI runtime lifecycle hardening, memory-policy contract enforcement, doctor/provenance reliability, incident verification gates, and the new opt-in Incident Studio integration (kept opt-in to avoid impacting the stable AI baseline).
- Also includes a localization cleanup and one deterministic textual ordering alignment to preserve contract tests (no functional change to runtime behavior).

Highlights:

- AI runtime and streaming hardening: deterministic model selection, safer fallback behaviors, stricter timeout and cancellation handling, duplicate stream-done prevention, and more defensive message parsing across host and webview flows.
- Memory and governance: local-processing memory policy profile surfaced and write-access contracts enforced end-to-end, memory influence audit timeline linked to decision artifacts.
- Incident Studio: new fullscreen redesign implemented as an opt-in webview (feature-flagged via `localStorage`). The redesign is shipped in-tree but does not alter existing AI command routing unless explicitly invoked.
- Doctor, provenance, and verify flows: stronger verify gates, provenance/export improvements, and deterministic verify/claim behavior to reduce false-positive success claims.
- CI & release governance: release-stop gate integration, parity snapshot checks, and smoke-matrix validation tightened for enterprise release posture.

Audit & validation:

- Full source-level audit: `npm run compile` and `tsc --noEmit` passed.
- Full test suite: `npx vitest run` — all tests passed (1013/1013) after a single safe textual ordering fix to satisfy a contract test.
- ESLint: warnings only (no blocking errors).

Release posture: `stabilization-only` (but consolidates many important stabilization and governance improvements)

Release posture: `stabilization-only`

## v0.27.0 (May 8, 2026)

### ✦ Stabilization Hardening Release

**Summary:** Enterprise-grade stabilization across routing, UI, telemetry, and test reliability. Extracts incident routing to a shared module, adds specialist intents, aligns phase-gate UI with backend telemetry gates, delivers data-driven action matrix, module graph tree, BYOP stack expansion, and enterprise gate fixtures.

**Quality gates:** typecheck ✓ | build ✓ | package ✓ | **731/731 tests ✓** (66 files)

**Release posture:** `stabilization-only` — expansion frozen until E1/E2/E3 enterprise epics green.

---

### Key Changes

- **`incidentRouting.ts`** — new shared routing module; specialist intents (DevOps/DB/Docs/Arch) with deterministic routing; tests import real implementation
- **Scope-aware suggested questions** — workspace vs project scope branching per specialist intent
- **Phase-gate UI** — `phaseContext` aligned with `telemetryRoutePrecisionPass`, `telemetryVerifyPathPass`, quality score ≥ 60, `verifiedOutcomes > 0`
- **Action Matrix** — stable matrix-prefixed IDs, resolver functions, canonical CLI action source
- **Module Graph Tree** — framework-grouped with severity filter + auto-reset stability guard
- **BYOP stacks** — django, flask, express, koa, rails, dotnet detection
- **Enterprise gate fixtures** — `consecutiveWindowsPass: 2` snapshots + posture label
- **Incident metrics + resume hardening** — NaN/negative sanitizers in telemetry and resume paths
- **Doctor telemetry** — `onError` hook + async catch for unhandled rejections
- **Release gate workflows** — paginated issue fetch, no fixture fallbacks, severity parser hardened
- **Test fixes** — 3 prompt policy route-precision tests corrected to reference `incidentRouting.ts`

### ✦ Stability & Strategic Alignment Release

**Summary:** Completes four independent hardening initiatives from the v0.25.0 session:

1. Browser smoke test action — new Incident Studio action type for AI-guided web application verification, aligned with VS Code 1.119 browser agent tools
2. Auto model selection regression fix — preserves literal `'auto'` string through all normalize helpers so Auto model UI state doesn't collapse
3. Smart rate-limit fallback — one-shot intelligent fallback on 429/quota/overloaded errors with cache reset before first streamed chunk
4. View controls UI polish — improved header button readability with larger icons/labels and dedicated CSS context

**Quality gates:** typecheck ✓ | build ✓ | 736/736 tests ✓

---

### Added

#### Browser Smoke Test Action (VS Code 1.119 Alignment)

New `browser-smoke-test` action type in Incident Studio enables AI-guided smoke testing of web applications. Opens project's dev server in VS Code simple browser and generates structured verification checklist:

**User trigger keywords:**

- `browser smoke`, `smoke test`, `ui smoke`
- `browser test`, `browser check`
- `verify ui`, `verify browser`, `open browser`

**AI generates report with:**

1. Smoke result (PASS/FAIL)
2. Verified endpoints (URL → HTTP status → pass/fail)
3. Detected issues
4. Recommended next step

**Implementation across four contract layers:**

1. **Action Matrix** (`incidentCliActionMatrix.ts`):
   - Entry ID: `project-browser-smoke-test`
   - Scope: `project` (project-scoped incidents only)
   - Stability: `advanced`
   - Command: `rapidkit dev`

2. **Prompt Policy** (`incidentStudioPromptPolicy.ts`):
   - Added to `INCIDENT_ACTION_ALLOWLIST`
   - Risk class: `non-mutating-executable` (read-only, no mutations)
   - Risk level: `low` (safe to execute automatically)
   - No impact review required
   - No verify-path required
   - Can complete incident without external verification

3. **Payload Contracts** (`incidentStudioPayload.ts`):
   - Integrated into `buildIncidentActionExecutionMetadata` non-mutating branch
   - Consistent risk classification across all layers

4. **Action Routing** (`welcomePanel.ts`):
   - New `RoutingResult` type variant: `'browser-smoke-test'`
   - Keyword matching for natural-language routing
   - Inline query builder that:
     - Detects running dev server port from `runningServers` registry
     - Opens VS Code simple browser with detected URL (graceful fallback if unavailable)
     - Generates AI-driven endpoint verification checklist

#### Model Selection Regression Fix

Fixed v0.25.0 regression where literal string `'auto'` was being normalized to null/undefined, breaking Auto model selection flow. All three normalize helpers now preserve `'auto'` as a real model value:

- `normalizeSelectedModelId(raw)` in `App.tsx`: converts only empty string → null; `'auto'` preserved
- `normalizeRequestedModelId(raw)` in `welcomePanel.ts`: converts only non-string or empty → undefined; `'auto'` preserved
- `normalizePreferredModelId(raw)` in `aiService.ts`: converts only empty string → undefined; any other string (including `'auto'`) preserved

**Impact:** Auto model selection now flows correctly through all three layers without collapsing to no-selection state.

#### Smart Rate-Limit Fallback

Implements intelligent one-shot fallback on retryable model errors (429, rate limit, quota, service unavailable, overloaded, busy):

**Error detection:**

- `isRetryableModelRequestError(err)`: regex matches 429, rate limit, quota, unavailable, overloaded, busy, service unavailable, model unavailable

**Fallback flow:**

1. `selectFallbackModelForFailure(failedModel)`: resets model selection cache and calls `selectModelAuto()` for alternative
2. If auto-select picks same model, falls back to raw model registry for different option
3. `emittedFromPrimary` guard: only retries if zero chunks streamed from primary (prevents duplicate partial responses)
4. Returns updated `modelId` if fallback succeeds

**Regression test:** new test validates that when autoModel throws 429, fallbackModel is called and full response is returned with correct fallback modelId. All 15 tests in aiService.test.ts passing.

#### Incident Studio View Controls UI

Improved readability of Maximize and Lite/Full view toggle buttons in header:

- Font-size: 10.2px for labels, 12px for icon symbols
- Font-weight: 800 (bold)
- Letter-spacing: 0.01em for visual clarity
- Min-height: 24px, padding: 4px 10px, gap: 6px
- CSS context `.incident-header-group--view` isolates sizing to View toggles only

---

### Fixed

- **driftGuard test assertion:** Updated `context: ctx, requestId` check to match multi-line object formatting in `App.tsx` (split into two separate assertions). Pre-existing formatting drift from earlier refactoring, no behavioral change to stop-generation contract.

---

### Quality Gates

- ✓ `npm run typecheck`: 0 TypeScript errors
- ✓ `npm run build`: esbuild main + webview build clean
- ✓ `npm run test`: **736/736 tests passing**
  - aiService.test.ts: 15/15 (includes new fallback test)
  - driftGuard.test.ts: 11/11 (updated assertion)
  - incidentStudioPromptPolicy.test.ts: policy checks passing

---

### Files Changed

**v0.25.0 hot-fixes + browser-smoke-test action:**

- src/core/aiService.ts — smart fallback + normalize helper
- src/ui/panels/incidentStudioPromptPolicy.ts — browser-smoke-test allowlist + policy
- src/ui/panels/welcomePanel.ts — model normalization + routing + inline query builder
- webview-ui/src/App.tsx — model normalization + View controls styles
- webview-ui/src/components/AIIncidentStudio.tsx — View controls UI
- webview-ui/src/lib/incidentCliActionMatrix.ts — browser-smoke-test action entry
- webview-ui/src/lib/incidentStudioPayload.ts — browser-smoke-test payload contracts
- webview-ui/src/styles-tailwind.css — View controls CSS
- src/test/aiService.test.ts — new fallback test
- src/test/driftGuard.test.ts — assertion fix
- package.json — version 0.25.0 → 0.26.0
- CHANGELOG.md, RELEASE_NOTES.md — documentation updates

---

### Compatibility

- ✓ No breaking changes (all changes backward-compatible)
- ✓ VS Code 1.119+ recommended for full browser agent tools integration
- ✓ Graceful fallback if VS Code simple browser unavailable
- ✓ Model normalization preserves existing behavior (only converts truly empty values)

## v0.25.0 (May 7, 2026)

### ✦ S01–S05 Full Stabilization Loop — Telemetry Breakdowns + Cohort Validation

**Summary:** Completes the full 5-KPI stabilization loop with false-positive protections. Every KPI now has an operational breakdown (S01 fallback mix, S02 miss reasons, S04 recovery class, S05 artifact cohort) that prevents aggregate metrics from masking degradation. Snapshot exports, UI cards, and operational docs updated end-to-end.

#### Added

- **S01 Fallback-reason breakdown**
  5-category classification (`success`, `bare_keyword_only`, `fix_preview_fallback`, `orchestrate_default`, `other`) computed from `next_action_clicked` events; visible in snapshot Markdown and card stats row.

- **S02 Verify-path miss reasons (top offenders)**
  Top-5 miss reasons by frequency extracted from `verify_passed`/`verify_failed` events where `verifyPathPresent=false`; included in snapshot and card.

- **S04 Recovery class breakdown**
  `auto_rollback` / `manual_recovery` / `unspecified` counts from rollback events; snapshot line `S04 recovery class mix` and card stats row added.

- **S05 Cohort validation**
  `repeatVerifiedWithArtifactReady` and `repeatVerifiedWithArtifactRate` metrics from `verified_outcome_ready_for_artifact` events with `repeatedIncident=true` and `replayReady=true`; new S05-Cohort card in Stabilization KPI gate UI.

- **Operational docs (KPI map, weekly template, 6-week plan, canonical story)**
  S01–S05 false-positive risk mitigation playbooks, threshold rules, weekly runbook steps, and False-Positive Prevention Checklist added to all four operational documents.

#### Changed

- Stabilization snapshot Markdown extended with S01 mix, S02 top misses, S04 class, S05 cohort lines.
- `StudioStabilizationKpiStatus` contract extended (optional fields, backward-compatible).
- S05 promoted from `Partial` to `Available` in KPI dictionary.

#### Validation Snapshot

- `npm run compile` → pass (no TS errors, webview esbuild clean)
- `npm run lint` → pass (no ESLint violations)
- `npm test -- --run` → 701/701 tests pass

### 🩺 Workspace Health Sidebar + Module Install Modal

**Summary:** Introduces the **Doctor Evidence Viewer** — a persistent sidebar panel that reads `.rapidkit/reports/doctor-last-run.json` and renders an inline health dashboard (score bar, system tool status, per-project issues) without any extra CLI call. Also wires the **Available Modules** sidebar item click directly into the same install confirmation modal used on the welcome page, so users see exactly what will be installed and where before confirming.

#### Added

- 🩺 **`WORKSPACE HEALTH` sidebar panel** (`DoctorEvidenceProvider`)
  - Reads `.rapidkit/reports/doctor-last-run.json` from the active workspace — zero CLI overhead
  - **Summary row:** health score bar (e.g. `70%  ███████░░░`) with `✅ passed  ⚠️ warnings  ❌ errors` counts
  - **Timestamp row:** `Last checked: Xm ago` with `(cached scan)` badge when CLI reused cache
  - **System Tools** (collapsible): per-tool status row — `✅ Python`, `⚠️ pipx`, `❌ ...` with message detail
  - **Projects** (collapsible): each project with health icon; unhealthy projects expand to show individual issues
  - **No-data state:** single click-to-run item (`No health data — run doctor to scan`)
  - **No-workspace state:** placeholder until workspace is selected
  - Three `view/title` toolbar icon buttons:
    - `$(run)` **Re-run Doctor** — opens terminal at workspace CWD, runs `npx rapidkit doctor workspace`
    - `$(wrench)` **Auto-fix Issues** — opens terminal, runs `npx rapidkit doctor workspace --fix`
    - `$(refresh)` **Refresh** — re-reads evidence file from disk immediately
  - **File watcher:** auto-refreshes the panel the moment the CLI writes new evidence (no manual refresh needed)
  - **Live workspace sync:** uses a live getter `() => workspaceExplorer.getSelectedWorkspace()` so the correct workspace is always used, regardless of initialization timing
  - **`onDidChangeTreeData` subscription:** workspace switch immediately triggers a panel reload

- 📦 **Module install modal from `AVAILABLE MODULES` sidebar**
  - New command `rapidkit.showModuleInstallModal`
  - Clicking any installable module in the sidebar now opens the **`InstallModuleModal`** — the same confirmation modal used by welcome page module cards
  - Modal shows: module name, version, description, category tags, installation target (workspace name + path), and exact CLI command (`npx rapidkit add module <slug>`)
  - User must explicitly click **Install Module** to proceed — no silent execution
  - Module data is normalized with `display_name` field to match the webview `ModuleData` interface

#### Changed

- 🔄 **Workspace-switch health refresh** now hooks directly into `workspaceExplorer.onDidChangeTreeData` — fires immediately after `selectedWorkspace` is updated, before any command event chain
- 🧩 **`WelcomePanel`** gains two new static methods:
  - `setExtensionContext(context)` — stores context so sidebar-triggered flows can open the panel without passing context through the call chain
  - `showModuleInstallModal(moduleData)` — opens the panel (if needed) and posts `openModuleInstallModal` to the React webview
- 🪟 **`App.tsx`** handles new `openModuleInstallModal` message — sets `selectedModule` and opens `showInstallModal`, identical to the welcome page card click flow

#### Fixed

- ⏱️ **Workspace Health not showing on reload** — fixed initial workspace path not being passed to the provider because `workspaceSelected` event only fires when workspace _changes_, not on first load. Now explicitly seeded after `workspaceExplorer.refresh()` completes.
- 🗂️ **Stale health data after workspace switch** — fixed by always re-reading evidence from disk in `getChildren` instead of relying on in-memory cache
