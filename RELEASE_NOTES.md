## v0.29.1 (May 23, 2026)

### ✦ Consolidated Stabilization & Feature Consolidation Release

Summary:
- This release consolidates a broad set of important stabilization, safety, and integration changes applied since `v0.29.0`. These are not "minor" editorial tweaks — they are deliberate stabilizations, safeguards, contract hardenings, and host/webview integrations that materially improve AI behavior, reliability, and governance.
- Notable surface areas include AI runtime lifecycle hardening, memory-policy contract enforcement, doctor/provenance reliability, incident verification gates, and the new opt-in Incident Studio integration (kept opt-in to avoid impacting the stable AI baseline).
- Also includes a localization cleanup and one deterministic textual ordering alignment to preserve contract tests (no functional change to runtime behavior).

Highlights:
- AI runtime and streaming hardening: deterministic model selection, safer fallback behaviors, stricter timeout and cancellation handling, duplicate stream-done prevention, and more defensive message parsing across host and webview flows.
- Memory and governance: local-processing memory policy profile surfaced and write-access contracts enforced end-to-end, memory influence audit timeline linked to decision artifacts.
- Incident Studio: new fullscreen redesign implemented as an opt-in webview (feature-flagged via `localStorage`). The redesign is shipped in-tree but does not alter existing AI command routing unless explicitly invoked.
- Doctor, provenance, and verify flows: stronger verify gates, provenance/export improvements, and deterministic verify/claim behavior to reduce false-positive success claims.
- CI & release governance: release-stop gate integration, parity snapshot checks, and smoke-matrix validation tightened for enterprise release posture.

Audit & validation:
- Full source-level audit: `npm run compile` and `tsc --noEmit` passed.
- Full test suite: `npx vitest run` — all tests passed (1013/1013) after a single safe textual ordering fix to satisfy a contract test.
- ESLint: warnings only (no blocking errors).

Release posture: `stabilization-only` (but consolidates many important stabilization and governance improvements)

Release posture: `stabilization-only`

## v0.27.0 (May 8, 2026)

### ✦ Stabilization Hardening Release

**Summary:** Enterprise-grade stabilization across routing, UI, telemetry, and test reliability. Extracts incident routing to a shared module, adds specialist intents, aligns phase-gate UI with backend telemetry gates, delivers data-driven action matrix, module graph tree, BYOP stack expansion, and enterprise gate fixtures.

**Quality gates:** typecheck ✓ | build ✓ | package ✓ | **731/731 tests ✓** (66 files)

**Release posture:** `stabilization-only` — expansion frozen until E1/E2/E3 enterprise epics green.

---

### Key Changes

- **`incidentRouting.ts`** — new shared routing module; specialist intents (DevOps/DB/Docs/Arch) with deterministic routing; tests import real implementation
- **Scope-aware suggested questions** — workspace vs project scope branching per specialist intent
- **Phase-gate UI** — `phaseContext` aligned with `telemetryRoutePrecisionPass`, `telemetryVerifyPathPass`, quality score ≥ 60, `verifiedOutcomes > 0`
- **Action Matrix** — stable matrix-prefixed IDs, resolver functions, canonical CLI action source
- **Module Graph Tree** — framework-grouped with severity filter + auto-reset stability guard
- **BYOP stacks** — django, flask, express, koa, rails, dotnet detection
- **Enterprise gate fixtures** — `consecutiveWindowsPass: 2` snapshots + posture label
- **Incident metrics + resume hardening** — NaN/negative sanitizers in telemetry and resume paths
- **Doctor telemetry** — `onError` hook + async catch for unhandled rejections
- **Release gate workflows** — paginated issue fetch, no fixture fallbacks, severity parser hardened
- **Test fixes** — 3 prompt policy route-precision tests corrected to reference `incidentRouting.ts`

### ✦ Stability & Strategic Alignment Release

**Summary:** Completes four independent hardening initiatives from the v0.25.0 session:
1. Browser smoke test action — new Incident Studio action type for AI-guided web application verification, aligned with VS Code 1.119 browser agent tools
2. Auto model selection regression fix — preserves literal `'auto'` string through all normalize helpers so Auto model UI state doesn't collapse
3. Smart rate-limit fallback — one-shot intelligent fallback on 429/quota/overloaded errors with cache reset before first streamed chunk
4. View controls UI polish — improved header button readability with larger icons/labels and dedicated CSS context

**Quality gates:** typecheck ✓ | build ✓ | 736/736 tests ✓

---

### Added

#### Browser Smoke Test Action (VS Code 1.119 Alignment)

New `browser-smoke-test` action type in Incident Studio enables AI-guided smoke testing of web applications. Opens project's dev server in VS Code simple browser and generates structured verification checklist:

**User trigger keywords:**
- `browser smoke`, `smoke test`, `ui smoke`
- `browser test`, `browser check`
- `verify ui`, `verify browser`, `open browser`

**AI generates report with:**
1. Smoke result (PASS/FAIL)
2. Verified endpoints (URL → HTTP status → pass/fail)
3. Detected issues
4. Recommended next step

**Implementation across four contract layers:**

1. **Action Matrix** (`incidentCliActionMatrix.ts`):
   - Entry ID: `project-browser-smoke-test`
   - Scope: `project` (project-scoped incidents only)
   - Stability: `advanced`
   - Command: `rapidkit dev`

2. **Prompt Policy** (`incidentStudioPromptPolicy.ts`):
   - Added to `INCIDENT_ACTION_ALLOWLIST`
   - Risk class: `non-mutating-executable` (read-only, no mutations)
   - Risk level: `low` (safe to execute automatically)
   - No impact review required
   - No verify-path required
   - Can complete incident without external verification

3. **Payload Contracts** (`incidentStudioPayload.ts`):
   - Integrated into `buildIncidentActionExecutionMetadata` non-mutating branch
   - Consistent risk classification across all layers

4. **Action Routing** (`welcomePanel.ts`):
   - New `RoutingResult` type variant: `'browser-smoke-test'`
   - Keyword matching for natural-language routing
   - Inline query builder that:
     - Detects running dev server port from `runningServers` registry
     - Opens VS Code simple browser with detected URL (graceful fallback if unavailable)
     - Generates AI-driven endpoint verification checklist

#### Model Selection Regression Fix

Fixed v0.25.0 regression where literal string `'auto'` was being normalized to null/undefined, breaking Auto model selection flow. All three normalize helpers now preserve `'auto'` as a real model value:

- `normalizeSelectedModelId(raw)` in `App.tsx`: converts only empty string → null; `'auto'` preserved
- `normalizeRequestedModelId(raw)` in `welcomePanel.ts`: converts only non-string or empty → undefined; `'auto'` preserved
- `normalizePreferredModelId(raw)` in `aiService.ts`: converts only empty string → undefined; any other string (including `'auto'`) preserved

**Impact:** Auto model selection now flows correctly through all three layers without collapsing to no-selection state.

#### Smart Rate-Limit Fallback

Implements intelligent one-shot fallback on retryable model errors (429, rate limit, quota, service unavailable, overloaded, busy):

**Error detection:**
- `isRetryableModelRequestError(err)`: regex matches 429, rate limit, quota, unavailable, overloaded, busy, service unavailable, model unavailable

**Fallback flow:**
1. `selectFallbackModelForFailure(failedModel)`: resets model selection cache and calls `selectModelAuto()` for alternative
2. If auto-select picks same model, falls back to raw model registry for different option
3. `emittedFromPrimary` guard: only retries if zero chunks streamed from primary (prevents duplicate partial responses)
4. Returns updated `modelId` if fallback succeeds

**Regression test:** new test validates that when autoModel throws 429, fallbackModel is called and full response is returned with correct fallback modelId. All 15 tests in aiService.test.ts passing.

#### Incident Studio View Controls UI

Improved readability of Maximize and Lite/Full view toggle buttons in header:

- Font-size: 10.2px for labels, 12px for icon symbols
- Font-weight: 800 (bold)
- Letter-spacing: 0.01em for visual clarity
- Min-height: 24px, padding: 4px 10px, gap: 6px
- CSS context `.incident-header-group--view` isolates sizing to View toggles only

---

### Fixed

- **driftGuard test assertion:** Updated `context: ctx, requestId` check to match multi-line object formatting in `App.tsx` (split into two separate assertions). Pre-existing formatting drift from earlier refactoring, no behavioral change to stop-generation contract.

---

### Quality Gates

- ✓ `npm run typecheck`: 0 TypeScript errors
- ✓ `npm run build`: esbuild main + webview build clean
- ✓ `npm run test`: **736/736 tests passing**
  - aiService.test.ts: 15/15 (includes new fallback test)
  - driftGuard.test.ts: 11/11 (updated assertion)
  - incidentStudioPromptPolicy.test.ts: policy checks passing

---

### Files Changed

**v0.25.0 hot-fixes + browser-smoke-test action:**
- src/core/aiService.ts — smart fallback + normalize helper
- src/ui/panels/incidentStudioPromptPolicy.ts — browser-smoke-test allowlist + policy
- src/ui/panels/welcomePanel.ts — model normalization + routing + inline query builder
- webview-ui/src/App.tsx — model normalization + View controls styles
- webview-ui/src/components/AIIncidentStudio.tsx — View controls UI
- webview-ui/src/lib/incidentCliActionMatrix.ts — browser-smoke-test action entry
- webview-ui/src/lib/incidentStudioPayload.ts — browser-smoke-test payload contracts
- webview-ui/src/styles-tailwind.css — View controls CSS
- src/test/aiService.test.ts — new fallback test
- src/test/driftGuard.test.ts — assertion fix
- package.json — version 0.25.0 → 0.26.0
- CHANGELOG.md, RELEASE_NOTES.md — documentation updates

---

### Compatibility

- ✓ No breaking changes (all changes backward-compatible)
- ✓ VS Code 1.119+ recommended for full browser agent tools integration
- ✓ Graceful fallback if VS Code simple browser unavailable
- ✓ Model normalization preserves existing behavior (only converts truly empty values)

---

## v0.25.0 (May 7, 2026)

### ✦ S01–S05 Full Stabilization Loop — Telemetry Breakdowns + Cohort Validation

**Summary:** Completes the full 5-KPI stabilization loop with false-positive protections. Every KPI now has an operational breakdown (S01 fallback mix, S02 miss reasons, S04 recovery class, S05 artifact cohort) that prevents aggregate metrics from masking degradation. Snapshot exports, UI cards, and operational docs updated end-to-end.

#### Added

- **S01 Fallback-reason breakdown**
  5-category classification (`success`, `bare_keyword_only`, `fix_preview_fallback`, `orchestrate_default`, `other`) computed from `next_action_clicked` events; visible in snapshot Markdown and card stats row.

- **S02 Verify-path miss reasons (top offenders)**
  Top-5 miss reasons by frequency extracted from `verify_passed`/`verify_failed` events where `verifyPathPresent=false`; included in snapshot and card.

- **S04 Recovery class breakdown**
  `auto_rollback` / `manual_recovery` / `unspecified` counts from rollback events; snapshot line `S04 recovery class mix` and card stats row added.

- **S05 Cohort validation**
  `repeatVerifiedWithArtifactReady` and `repeatVerifiedWithArtifactRate` metrics from `verified_outcome_ready_for_artifact` events with `repeatedIncident=true` and `replayReady=true`; new S05-Cohort card in Stabilization KPI gate UI.

- **Operational docs (KPI map, weekly template, 6-week plan, canonical story)**
  S01–S05 false-positive risk mitigation playbooks, threshold rules, weekly runbook steps, and False-Positive Prevention Checklist added to all four operational documents.

#### Changed

- Stabilization snapshot Markdown extended with S01 mix, S02 top misses, S04 class, S05 cohort lines.
- `StudioStabilizationKpiStatus` contract extended (optional fields, backward-compatible).
- S05 promoted from `Partial` to `Available` in KPI dictionary.

#### Validation Snapshot

- `npm run compile` → pass (no TS errors, webview esbuild clean)
- `npm run lint` → pass (no ESLint violations)
- `npm test -- --run` → 701/701 tests pass

### 🩺 Workspace Health Sidebar + Module Install Modal

**Summary:** Introduces the **Doctor Evidence Viewer** — a persistent sidebar panel that reads `.rapidkit/reports/doctor-last-run.json` and renders an inline health dashboard (score bar, system tool status, per-project issues) without any extra CLI call. Also wires the **Available Modules** sidebar item click directly into the same install confirmation modal used on the welcome page, so users see exactly what will be installed and where before confirming.

#### Added

- 🩺 **`WORKSPACE HEALTH` sidebar panel** (`DoctorEvidenceProvider`)
  - Reads `.rapidkit/reports/doctor-last-run.json` from the active workspace — zero CLI overhead
  - **Summary row:** health score bar (e.g. `70%  ███████░░░`) with `✅ passed  ⚠️ warnings  ❌ errors` counts
  - **Timestamp row:** `Last checked: Xm ago` with `(cached scan)` badge when CLI reused cache
  - **System Tools** (collapsible): per-tool status row — `✅ Python`, `⚠️ pipx`, `❌ ...` with message detail
  - **Projects** (collapsible): each project with health icon; unhealthy projects expand to show individual issues
  - **No-data state:** single click-to-run item (`No health data — run doctor to scan`)
  - **No-workspace state:** placeholder until workspace is selected
  - Three `view/title` toolbar icon buttons:
    - `$(run)` **Re-run Doctor** — opens terminal at workspace CWD, runs `npx rapidkit doctor workspace`
    - `$(wrench)` **Auto-fix Issues** — opens terminal, runs `npx rapidkit doctor workspace --fix`
    - `$(refresh)` **Refresh** — re-reads evidence file from disk immediately
  - **File watcher:** auto-refreshes the panel the moment the CLI writes new evidence (no manual refresh needed)
  - **Live workspace sync:** uses a live getter `() => workspaceExplorer.getSelectedWorkspace()` so the correct workspace is always used, regardless of initialization timing
  - **`onDidChangeTreeData` subscription:** workspace switch immediately triggers a panel reload

- 📦 **Module install modal from `AVAILABLE MODULES` sidebar**
  - New command `rapidkit.showModuleInstallModal`
  - Clicking any installable module in the sidebar now opens the **`InstallModuleModal`** — the same confirmation modal used by welcome page module cards
  - Modal shows: module name, version, description, category tags, installation target (workspace name + path), and exact CLI command (`npx rapidkit add module <slug>`)
  - User must explicitly click **Install Module** to proceed — no silent execution
  - Module data is normalized with `display_name` field to match the webview `ModuleData` interface

#### Changed

- 🔄 **Workspace-switch health refresh** now hooks directly into `workspaceExplorer.onDidChangeTreeData` — fires immediately after `selectedWorkspace` is updated, before any command event chain
- 🧩 **`WelcomePanel`** gains two new static methods:
  - `setExtensionContext(context)` — stores context so sidebar-triggered flows can open the panel without passing context through the call chain
  - `showModuleInstallModal(moduleData)` — opens the panel (if needed) and posts `openModuleInstallModal` to the React webview
- 🪟 **`App.tsx`** handles new `openModuleInstallModal` message — sets `selectedModule` and opens `showInstallModal`, identical to the welcome page card click flow

#### Fixed

- ⏱️ **Workspace Health not showing on reload** — fixed initial workspace path not being passed to the provider because `workspaceSelected` event only fires when workspace *changes*, not on first load. Now explicitly seeded after `workspaceExplorer.refresh()` completes.
- 🗂️ **Stale health data after workspace switch** — fixed by always re-reading evidence from disk in `getChildren` instead of relying on in-memory cache
