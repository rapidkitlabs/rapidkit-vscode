and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.29.0] - 2026-05-19

### Added

- **Welcome panel chat brain tracking support** via new panel helper module:
  - `src/ui/panels/welcomePanelChatBrainTracking.ts`

### Changed

- **AI stream/runtime stabilization finalized** across host and panel paths:
  - deterministic model alias matching and safer model fallback behavior
  - request timeout and cancellation lifecycle hardening in stream execution
  - stream done signaling tightened to avoid duplicate terminal events
  - module suggestion parsing and AI response handling made more defensive
- **Command path typing hardening (enterprise consistency)**:
  - legacy command handlers migrated from unsafe `any` usage to guarded typed/unknown flows
  - workspace/project selection command contracts aligned with provider models
  - project creation command imports normalized to static imports and strict error narrowing
- **Doctor and provenance command reliability** improved through strict typing and safer contract parsing.

### Fixed

- **Type contract regressions blocking compile** in workspace/project selection integration (`workspaceSelection` <-> `extension` wiring).
- **Add module command type-safety bug** in slug resolution and selected-project payload narrowing.
- **AI service test parity** updated to match cancellation semantics and prevent stale done-event assumptions.

### Verification

## [0.28.0] - 2026-05-13

### Added

- **Enterprise E1/E2 execution slice** shipped across Incident Studio contracts:
  - **E1 baseline hardening** with versioned cross-service impact score contract (`v1`) and execution-complete confidence/scope safeguards.
  - **E2.1** local-processing memory policy profile exposure (`policyProfile`, `sensitivity`, `localProcessingMode`) in host and payload contracts.
  - **E2.2** memory write-access contract enforcement for workspace memory write paths.
  - **E2.3** repro-pack sensitivity labels end-to-end (host evidence, payload normalization, UI rendering, and export bundle contract).
  - **E2.4** memory influence audit timeline linked to decision artifacts across host -> payload -> UI -> export flow.
  - **E2.5** security review hardening coverage for memory/export paths (contract/drift/test enforcement).
- **Release governance tooling**:
  - `scripts/export-open-issues-report.mjs` added for release issue-severity evidence export.
  - release-stop gate integration and workflow usage for open-issue severity blocking.

### Changed

- **CI release gate enforcement** strengthened:
  - `.github/workflows/extension-smoke-matrix.yml` now enforces release-stop checks with open-issue severity inputs.
  - `scripts/release-stop-gate.mjs` and package scripts aligned to stricter stop-gate behavior.
- **Incident Studio host/webview contracts** updated for memory-policy governance, repro-pack security labels, and artifact-linked audit timeline evidence.
- **Impact and architecture reasoning safety** strengthened through updated system graph and lens contracts, with expanded scenario and fixture coverage.

### Fixed

- **Fail-closed mutation safety regressions prevented** with expanded drift guard and flow-level assertions for unknown-scope and policy-bound routes.
- **Memory/export redaction consistency** tightened so sensitive fields remain sanitized in normalized payloads and link-safe bundle exports.

### Verification

- Core enterprise stabilization suites for E1/E2 slices pass in the release range:
  - `src/test/impactScoreScenarioMatrix.test.ts`
  - `src/test/systemGraphIndexer.test.ts`
  - `src/test/workspaceMemoryService.test.ts`
  - `src/test/incidentReproPackUtils.test.ts`
  - `src/test/incidentStudioPayload.test.ts`
  - `src/test/AIIncidentStudio.interaction.test.ts`
  - `src/test/driftGuard.test.ts`
- Commit scope included in this release is the full range from tag `v0.27.3` to current `HEAD`.

## [0.27.3] - 2026-05-12

### Added

- **Incident Studio policy modules** — added new policy/evidence helper modules under `src/ui/panels/`:
  - `incidentStudioPolicyGates.ts`
  - `incidentStudioResponseValidator.ts`
  - `incidentStudioVerifyRerun.ts`
  - `incidentStudioVerifyDiff.ts`
  - `incidentStudioEvidenceMapping.ts`
  - `incidentStudioEvidenceProvenance.ts`
  - `incidentStudioConfidenceUI.ts`
  - `incidentStudioExportProvenance.ts`
- **Core backend contract modules**:
  - `src/core/backendFrameworkContract.ts` (framework/runtime -> stack contract)
  - `src/core/verifyPackContractExporter.ts` (export verify-pack contract to `.rapidkit/reports`)
  - `src/core/workspaceHygieneProbes.ts` (duplicate-deps, SCM hygiene, README framework alignment)
- **Parity snapshot automation** — added deterministic shared snapshot sync/check commands:
  - `sync:parity-snapshot`
  - `check:parity-snapshot`
  - `contracts/backend-import-stack-parity.snapshot.json`
  - `scripts/sync-import-stack-parity-snapshot.mjs`
- **Release notes artifact** — added `releases/RELEASE_NOTES_v0.27.3.md`.
- **Regression suites** — added focused test coverage for policy gates, verifier rerun/diff, evidence provenance/export, response contract validation, workspace boundary matching, and parity snapshot checks.

### Changed

- **Incident Studio claim coherence (webview)** — `webview-ui/src/components/AIIncidentStudio.tsx` now enforces NO-GO/verify-gate truth in UI claims:
  - blocks success messaging when verify/release gates are unsatisfied
  - downgrades GO to gated HOLD when verify completion gates are not met
  - surfaces explicit scope-truth and flow-vs-telemetry labels
  - guided mode now renders deterministic next+verify intent chips and hides dense action board panel
- **Command transport + display separation**:
  - execution path normalized to portable `npx --yes --package rapidkit rapidkit ...`
  - user-facing command rendering simplified to `rapidkit ...`
  - applied across Incident Studio, command reference, and welcome panel pathways
- **Workspace stabilization telemetry model** (`src/utils/workspaceUsageTracker.ts`):
  - added thresholds/metrics/gates for:
    - `routeFallbackNonSuccessShare`
    - `verifyIncompleteWarningRate`
    - `topVerifyPathMissReasonShare`
  - propagated to payload contract types and Incident Studio KPI cards/exports
- **Welcome panel runtime hardening** (`src/ui/panels/welcomePanel.ts`):
  - explicit shell dispatch per OS for terminal-bridge execution
  - incident telemetry refresh wrapped with safe fallback postMessage
  - command scope detection expanded for workspace-level rapidkit actions
- **Release gate enforcement in CI** — removed KPI bypass from smoke matrix release gate and switched to fixture-backed inputs (`wave3-kpi-marker`, claim checklist, enterprise gate, release posture label).
- **Formatting gate in CI** — added `format:check` to smoke workflow (non-Windows) for local/CI parity.

### Fixed

- **Workspace path prefix-collision bug** — `src/utils/findWorkspace.ts` now uses normalized boundary-safe containment checks, so sibling paths like `workspace-other` are no longer treated as nested under `workspace`.
- **Doctor command messaging parity** — doctor evidence tooltips/context hints now use the portable canonical invocation.
- **Formatting consistency in release branch** — normalized prettier formatting on high-churn files used by validation.

## [0.27.2] - 2026-05-10

### Fixed

- **Webview disposal safety** — prevented `Webview is disposed` uncaught errors in the Setup panel:
  - All `postMessage` calls are now guarded by a `_safePostMessage()` helper that checks disposal state before sending
  - Added `_isDisposing` flag set immediately on `onDidDispose` to stop any in-flight async callbacks
  - Registered message listener via `this._disposables` for proper cleanup lifecycle
  - Eliminated three uncaught errors (`Webview is disposed`) visible in the extension host output when closing the Setup panel

## [0.27.1] - 2026-05-10

### Added

- **Workspace Run command suite** — added first-class workspace stage commands and picker flow:
  - `workspai.workspaceRunStage`
  - `workspai.workspaceRunInit`
  - `workspai.workspaceRunTest`
  - `workspai.workspaceRunBuild`
  - `workspai.workspaceRunStart`

- **AI Workspace Command Center** — added `workspai.aiWorkspaceCommandCenter` with a categorized operation launcher for workspace navigation, health, and governance commands.

- **Project-scoped Doctor command** — added `workspai.projectDoctor` with explicit Check/Fix selection and project-aware routing from Incident Studio.

- **Doctor treatment telemetry envelope** — Incident Studio telemetry now includes `doctorTreatmentStatus` (trend, drift deltas, scope provenance, traceability coverage, probe failures/warnings) and corresponding UI rendering.

### Changed

- **Workspace init execution path** — `workspai.workspaceInit` now runs canonical `workspace run init` flow for consistent fleet-stage semantics.

- **Workspace operations targeting** — normalized workspace target resolution from command payloads and selection context across workspace operations and selection commands.

- **Incident Studio command wiring** — doctor actions route to workspace/project-aware commands, adds project doctor report access, and improves scope-aware labels in telemetry UI.

- **AI command catalog** — expanded AI action surface with workspace governance and command-center integration; command documentation aligned to `npx rapidkit ...` syntax.

### Fixed

- **Sensitive path exposure in doctor/compliance surfaces** — outputs now use link-safe/sanitized path hints instead of leaking full absolute report directories.

- **Command docs and hints parity** — corrected stale command hints such as `npx workspai.doctor workspace` to canonical `npx rapidkit doctor workspace`.

- **Drift guard/test alignment** — updated drift assertions and Incident Studio telemetry tests to match current command contracts and doctor treatment payload shape.

## [0.27.0] - 2026-05-08

### Added

- **Incident routing shared module** — extracted all action-type routing logic into `incidentRouting.ts` (`routeIncidentActionTypeFromMessage`). Eliminates drift between panel implementation and tests; tests now import the real function directly rather than asserting on source text. `RoutingResult` type is exported and shared across routing consumers.

- **Specialist intent routing** — four new deterministic routing branches in the incident router:
  - **DevOps/CI-CD** (`ci/cd`, `pipeline`, `kubernetes`, `helm`, `dockerfile`, `docker compose`) → `doctor-fix`
  - **Database/schema** (`schema`, `migration`, `sql`, `postgres`, `mysql`, `mongodb`) → `change-impact-lite`
  - **Docs/runbook/ADR** (`documentation`, `readme`, `runbook`, `adr`) → `workspace-memory-wizard`
  - **Architecture/risk** (`architecture`, `risk`, `blast radius`, `refactor plan`) → `change-impact-lite`

- **Scope-aware suggested questions** — `_buildSuggestedQuestions` accepts `scopeIntent: 'workspace' | 'project'` and returns deterministic, non-generic questions per specialist intent and standard action type. Workspace scope surfaces topology/governance questions; project scope surfaces per-service execution questions.

- **Phase-gate UI alignment** — `phaseContext` in `AIIncidentStudio.tsx` aligned with backend telemetry gates:
  - `diagnosisReady`: `telemetryHardGatePass` as corroborating signal
  - `planReady`: blocked when `telemetryRoutePrecisionPass` is false and telemetry data exists
  - `verifyReady`: requires `qualityScore >= 60` for verify-pack path; `telemetryVerifyPathPass` as alternative pass signal
  - `priorResolutionAvailable`: extended with `verifiedOutcomeLoopStatus.verifiedOutcomes > 0`

- **Data-driven Action Matrix** — `incidentCliActionMatrix.ts` refactored to a canonical source: stable matrix-prefixed IDs, explicit workspace/project scope per entry, `actionTypes` array for routing resolution, and two resolver functions (`resolveIncidentCliActionByActionType`, `resolveIncidentCliActionIdByActionType`) for end-to-end routing alignment.

- **Module Graph Tree in Incident Studio** — doctor evidence payload enriched with `installedModules` from registry manifests; `AIIncidentStudio.tsx` renders framework-grouped module graph with interactive filters (framework dropdown, severity: healthy/warning/critical, module search) and a stability guard that auto-resets the framework filter when the selected framework is no longer present in the dataset.

- **BYOP stack expansion** — `detectProjectStack` extended with BYOP-first detection for six additional stacks: `django`, `flask`, `express`, `koa`, `rails`, `dotnet`. Discovery uses framework-specific file markers (`manage.py`, `wsgi.py`, `app.py`, `app.js`/`server.js`, `Gemfile`/`config/routes.rb`, `*.csproj`/`*.sln`).

- **Enterprise gate fixtures** — `releases/fixtures/wave2-enterprise-gate.json` and `wave3-enterprise-gate.json` provide deterministic gate snapshots with `consecutiveWindowsPass: 2` for regression protection. `releases/fixtures/release-posture-label.md` labels current posture as `stabilization-only`.

- **Incident conversation metrics** — new `incidentConversationMetrics.ts` module: `buildIncidentLifecycleMetrics(input, nowMs)` sanitizes malformed numbers/timestamps before telemetry emission, preventing NaN or negative values from corrupting KPI windows.

- **Incident resume snapshot hardening** — `incidentStudioResume.ts` adds `toNonNegativeInteger`, `toNonNegativeTimestamp`, and `toValidTurns` sanitizers to `buildIncidentResumeSnapshot`; malformed turn counts and timestamps are clamped to safe values.

### Changed

- **Doctor telemetry refresh** — `doctorTelemetryRefresh.ts` adds `onError` hook and async catch in the refresh executor, preventing unhandled promise rejections from crashing the extension host on telemetry refresh failures.

- **Release gate workflows** — `release-gate-wave2.yml` and `release-gate-wave3.yml` hardened: severity parser extracted to shared helper, paginated GitHub issue fetch replaces single-page query, fixture fallback paths removed (hard-fail when KPI marker is missing).

- **Test regression coverage** — three `incidentStudioPromptPolicy.test.ts` route-precision tests updated to read from `incidentRouting.ts` (the real implementation) rather than `welcomePanel.ts`. Test suite: **731/731 tests passing** (66 files).

### Fixed

- **Prompt policy route-precision test source paths** — `route precision: doctor-fix and recipe-pack`, `terminal-bridge requires explicit terminal signal`, and `fix-preview-lite requires patch context` tests were asserting on `welcomePanel.ts` source after routing logic was extracted to `incidentRouting.ts`. Tests now correctly reference the live routing module.

## [0.26.0] - 2026-05-08

### Added

- **Browser smoke test action** — new `browser-smoke-test` action type in Incident Studio, aligned with VS Code 1.119 browser agent tools. The action enables AI-guided smoke testing of web applications by opening the project's running dev server in VS Code's simple browser and asking the AI to verify key UI surfaces, endpoints, and HTTP status codes. Fully integrated across all four contract layers: action matrix, prompt policy, payload contracts, and routing logic.

- **Smart rate-limit fallback** — implements one-shot intelligent fallback on retryable model errors (429, rate limit, quota, service unavailable, overloaded). Fallback only triggers before first chunk is streamed (prevents duplicate partial responses), includes automatic model selection cache reset via `resetModelSelectionCache()`, and falls back to raw model registry if auto-selection picks the same model again. Adds `emittedFromPrimary` guard and returns updated `modelId` on successful fallback.

- **Regression test for fallback** — new test in `aiService.test.ts`: `"falls back to another model when initial request fails with retryable rate-limit error"`. Validates that when autoModel throws 429, fallbackModel is called and streamed response is returned with correct fallback modelId.

### Changed

- **Model selection normalization semantics** — fixes v0.25.0 regression where literal string `'auto'` was being converted to null/undefined. All three normalize helpers (`normalizeSelectedModelId` in App.tsx, `normalizeRequestedModelId` in welcomePanel.ts, `normalizePreferredModelId` in aiService.ts) now preserve `'auto'` as a real model value and only convert truly empty strings/whitespace to null/undefined. This ensures the Auto model selection UI state doesn't collapse when users explicitly request Auto model.

- **Incident Studio View controls styling** — improved readability of Maximize and Lite/Full view toggle buttons by increasing font-size to 10.2px for labels, 12px for icon symbols, adding letter-spacing 0.01em, and setting font-weight 800 for bold emphasis. Used dedicated `.incident-header-group--view` CSS context selector to isolate sizing to View toggles only, preventing impact on other header chips.

### Fixed

- **driftGuard test assertion** — updated `keeps AI modal stop-generation contract aligned across webview and panel` test to split the assertion for `context: ctx, requestId` into two separate checks (`context: ctx,` and `requestId,`) matching the actual multi-line object formatting in `App.tsx`. This was a pre-existing formatting drift from earlier refactoring with no functional impact to the modal stop-generation contract itself.

## [0.25.0] - 2026-05-07

### Added

- **S01 fallback-reason breakdown** — `fallbackReasonBreakdown` now classified into 5 categories (`success`, `bare_keyword_only`, `fix_preview_fallback`, `orchestrate_default`, `other`) for every `next_action_clicked` event; visible in Stabilization KPI snapshot and card UI. Prevents false-positive route-precision claims by exposing fallback mix distribution.
- **S02 verify-path miss reasons (top offenders)** — `verifyPathReasonTop` tracks top-5 miss reasons by frequency; included in snapshot Markdown export and Stabilization KPI card. Drives weekly remediation backlog for verify-path gaps.
- **S04 recovery class breakdown** — `recoveryClassBreakdown` segments rollback events into `auto_rollback`, `manual_recovery`, `unspecified`; included in snapshot export and card stats row. Prevents aggregate recovery rate hiding manual-burden shifts.
- **S05 cohort validation** — `repeatVerifiedWithArtifactReady` and `repeatVerifiedWithArtifactRate` track repeated incidents that have both `repeatedIncident=true` and `replayReady=true` on the `verified_outcome_ready_for_artifact` event. New S05-Cohort metric card added to Stabilization KPI gate UI.
- **False-positive risk mitigation docs** — KPI map, weekly dashboard template, 6-week plan, and canonical story updated with S01–S05 operational playbooks, thresholds, remediation owners, and weekly runbook.

### Changed

- **Stabilization KPI snapshot** — Markdown export now includes S01 fallback mix, S02 top miss reasons, S04 recovery class mix, and S05 cohort stats in addition to S01–S05 gate table.
- **`StudioStabilizationKpiStatus` metrics contract** — extended with `fallbackReasonBreakdown`, `verifyPathReasonTop`, `recoveryClassBreakdown`, `repeatVerifiedWithArtifactReady`, and `repeatVerifiedWithArtifactRate` fields (all optional, backward-compatible).
- **KPI Dictionary status** — S05 promoted from `Partial` to `Available` (cohort validation via artifact/replay ID linking now instrumented).

## [0.24.1] - 2026-05-06

### Added

- **AI-first dashboard spotlighting** - added compact AI Features cards, a featured Incident Studio entry point, a Quick Links "build with AI" cue, and editor quick-fixes README coverage with screenshot 8.
- **Project kit recovery affordance** - added an on-demand kit retry path when the project modal opens before available kits have loaded.

### Changed

- **Incident Studio control-surface polish** - reworked header controls, mode/view layout, maximize behavior, active-scope presentation, and removed the redundant project/workspace context bar.
- **Navigation and setup affordances** - updated dashboard/Incident Studio tabs, setup entry points, and scope syncing between host and webview so users land in the right surface with the right context.
- **README and product messaging refresh** - streamlined README copy, aligned screenshots 1-8, and reinforced backend AI workflow positioning including Spring Boot support.

### Fixed

- **Project Explorer add-module routing** - fixed right-click add-module payload serialization so project actions no longer fail on circular command arguments.
- **Analyze/test visual ambiguity** - separated Analyze visuals from Run Tests with AI-themed icons and corrected tab/button alignment regressions.
- **Incident Studio state and first-open races** - fixed stale scope synchronization, first-open kit loading gaps, and the header regression introduced during layout compaction.

## [0.24.0] - 2026-05-05

### Added

- **CLC1 decision clarity contract** — added a single structured decision clarity payload for Incident Studio actionable outputs with situation, reason, scope, risk, next step, verify plan, rollback plan, and evidence links.
- **CLC5 outcome KPI model** — added `incidentOutcomeKpi` computation and marker telemetry records for first-action success, reopen, override, verify completion, rollback success, and time-to-first-confident-action.
- **Artifact criteria and mode adapters** — added `incidentArtifactCriteria` and `incidentUxModeAdapter` modules with dedicated acceptance and regression test coverage.

### Changed

- **CLC2 mutation safety enforcement** — moved decision field validation to pre-execution and block completion/mutation-ready language whenever required clarity fields are missing.
- **CLC3 deterministic phase policy wiring** — connected phase rail and next-action behavior to deterministic policy evaluation instead of heuristic progression.
- **CLC6 UX mode behavior hardening** — applied Guided/Standard/Expert policy consistently to primary and secondary CTAs, including multi-CTA paths.
- **CLC7 evidence rendering coverage** — completed UI wiring for all artifact kinds (verify, diagnosis, sandbox, rollback, repro) with explicit per-criterion status display and styles.
- **Release stop gate integration** — made outcome KPI checks part of mandatory release gate `overallPass` evaluation.

### Fixed

- **Decision clarity dead path** — fixed host-to-webview contract so decision clarity is emitted in `aiChatActionResult` and no longer remains an unused card path.
- **Mode bypass and criteria styling gaps** — fixed Expert-mode action filtering bypass and missing criteria/card status classes in Incident Studio styles.

## [0.23.0] - 2026-05-05

### Added

- 🧭 **Enterprise import and BYOP readiness surfaces** — expanded import command flow, workspace/project integration points, and extension wiring for safer multi-workspace onboarding and drift control.
- 📈 **W07/W08 validation instrumentation** — added release-readiness decision outcome tracking (`GO`/`NO-GO`) and artifact-linked validation telemetry to support decision accuracy and incident-prevention KPIs.
- 🌙 **Nightly Incident Studio soak workflow** — introduced dedicated soak automation workflow to continuously exercise Incident Studio stability paths.
- 🧪 **Contract runtime and stress regression coverage** — added `workspaiContractRuntime` module and tests plus broader release-stop/stress validation suites.

### Changed

- 🚦 **Wave 3 release-stop gate visibility** — gate output now includes release-readiness validation metrics and clearer KPI evidence blocks alongside existing hard-gate signals.
- 🧩 **Incident Studio host/webview contract parity** — synchronized payload normalization, prompt policy, telemetry typing, and panel behavior across extension and webview layers.
- ⚙️ **Core command and workspace orchestration** — refined command routing and workspace operations for stronger enterprise reliability in cross-project flows.

### Fixed

- 🛡️ **Claim and scope safety alignment** — tightened shipped-scope wording and evidence alignment to avoid over-claiming behavior outside verified release boundaries.
- 🔧 **Telemetry type and gate regression mismatches** — resolved time-window compatibility and stabilized targeted release-gate regressions for newly added KPIs.

## [0.22.0] - 2026-04-29

### Added

- 🚨 **Incident Studio foundation** — shipped the core AI Incident Studio experience with lifecycle-aware payload contracts, graph-backed action handling, protocol fixtures, support panels for memory/resume/telemetry/prompt policy, and end-to-end regression coverage.
- 🧭 **System graph + Architecture Lens baseline** — added the workspace system graph indexer, deterministic blast-radius scoring, Incident Studio Architecture Lens, editor CodeLens surface, and inline architecture warnings for supported source files.
- 🔁 **Release gate and rollback baseline** — added wave-2 stop-gate automation, release gate manifest/KPI wiring, verify-first policy enforcement, hard-gate telemetry, and verify-fail auto-rollback evidence plumbing.
- 🧰 **Setup and workspace operations upgrade** — replaced the old setup panel with the new setup experience, added workspace share bundle import/export flows in the dashboard, restored module browser responsiveness, and expanded workspace/project command coverage.
- 🩺 **Doctor and telemetry surfaces** — added doctor telemetry refresh views and richer project context/log reporting for release gating and runtime observability.
- 🧪 **Deep regression coverage** — added contract, flow, graph, telemetry, release-gate, workspace-share, and A08-specific tests across the extension and webview layers.

### Changed

- 🧠 **AI context pipeline hardening** — introduced a formal AI context contract and resolver, expanded project-context extraction, refreshed system prompt/prompt message shaping, and aligned AI/debug/chat flows on the same context-rich path.
- 🖥️ **UI and webview modernization** — refreshed large parts of the dashboard, Actions, setup, project creation, and incident surfaces to support the new Workspai workflows and responsive layouts.
- 🧩 **Command/provider/schema alignment** — updated command handlers, config-file completion/hover support, schemas, tree views, wizards, and extension activation wiring so the new surfaces work coherently in-editor and in-webview.
- 📦 **Dependency security refresh** — lockfile dependencies were refreshed through `npm audit fix`, clearing current production dependency findings for the release line.

### Fixed

- 🔒 **Prompt and mutation safety** — tightened prompt sanitization, adversarial-input guards, verify-readiness enforcement, and unknown-scope blocking so risky actions degrade safely.
- 🔄 **Workspace flow stability** — fixed workspace detection, project switching, sync cache invalidation, partial-failure normalization, webview readiness races, and module browser responsiveness.
- 🧩 **Architecture evidence fragmentation** — impact, predictive, and release-gate signals are now presented as one coherent architecture review surface instead of several loosely related cards.
- 🛡️ **Production dependency audit findings** — runtime npm audit findings are resolved for the current shipped dependency tree; only upstream dev-tooling issues without an available fix remain.

## [0.21.0] - 2026-04-23

### Added

- ✦ **AI action surface expansion** — added AI flow commands to the extension command palette and menus: `workspai.aiQuickActions`, `workspai.aiOrchestrate`, `workspai.aiFixPreviewLite`, `workspai.aiChangeImpactLite`, `workspai.aiTerminalBridge`, `workspai.aiWorkspaceMemoryWizard`, and `workspai.aiRecipePacks`.
- 📊 **Telemetry commands + onboarding experiment analytics** — new commands `workspai.showTelemetrySummary`, `workspai.resetTelemetry`, `workspai.showAIFeatureOnboarding`, and `workspai.showOnboardingExperimentStats` with workspace-scoped summaries and experiment CTR analysis.
- 🧭 **AI onboarding tour** — in-product AI onboarding messages with follow-up toast variants and command telemetry events for onboarding flows.

### Changed

- 🧱 **Sidebar and webview quick-action alignment** — WORKSPACES / PROJECTS inline action ordering now matches the expanded AI flow model; Actions webview now exposes AI Flows, telemetry, and onboarding shortcuts.
- 🧠 **Telemetry instrumentation coverage** — both `@workspai` chat participant and AI modal now emit structured success/error/cancel outcome telemetry with context-safe guards.
- 🎛️ **Project context insights panel** — new workspace telemetry and onboarding experiment summary views in `projectContextAndLogs` with copyable quick summaries.

### Fixed

- 🩺 **Doctor network safety** — version metadata fetch now enforces timeout, redirect bounds, and same-host redirect checks to reduce hangs and unsafe redirect behavior.
- 🚀 **Dev server port probing resilience** — project start flow now uses bounded port scan attempts with warning fallback instead of unbounded recursive probing.
- 📁 **Workspace registry initialization race** — config directory creation is now synchronous at startup to avoid first-run path timing issues.

## [0.20.0] - 2026-04-20

### Added

- 🤖 **`@workspai` Chat Participant** — register `@workspai` in the VS Code Chat panel with two slash commands: `/ask` (full-context Q&A scoped to the active project) and `/debug` (structured debug flow: root cause + fix + prevention). Reuses the same `prepareAIConversation → streamAIResponse` pipeline as the Workspai modal for identical AI quality.
- ✦ **AI Create presets** — the AI Create modal now ships with categorised quick-fill prompt options (SaaS & commerce, core backend, microservices, data & ML, internal tools). Smart scoring surfaces the most relevant presets based on partial user input.
- 📊 **"Which backend next?" poll** — in-sidebar quick poll lets users vote for the next supported framework (Django / Express / Spring); result is acknowledged inline.
- 🔧 **Workspace bootstrap, setup, init, policy, cache, mirror commands** — new `workspai.workspaceBootstrap`, `workspai.workspaceSetup`, `workspai.workspaceInit`, `workspai.workspacePolicyShow/Set`, `workspai.cacheStatus/Clear/Prune/Repair`, `workspai.mirrorStatus/Sync/Verify/Rotate`, and `workspai.checkForUpdates` commands registered and palette-accessible.
- 🧪 **WorkspaceMemoryService unit tests** — new `src/test/workspaceMemoryService.test.ts` covering read/write, sanitisation, timestamp validation, and concurrent-access paths.

### Changed

- 🧠 **Workspace memory hardening** — `WorkspaceMemoryService` now validates and sanitises all `context`, `conventions`, `decisions`, and `lastUpdated` fields on every read, auto-corrects corrupt entries, and writes back only the cleaned structure.
- ⚡ **Live module list in AI context** — `aiService` now fetches the available module catalogue directly from the CLI (`rapidkit modules list --json-schema 1`) with a 60-second in-process TTL cache, so AI responses reference the real current module set rather than a static snapshot.
- 🔁 **Idempotent workspace creation** — `createWorkspace` now detects partial directories (directory exists, no `.rapidkit-workspace` marker) and offers a "Replace (delete & recreate)" prompt; if the workspace marker already exists the CLI call is skipped entirely for a silent success.
- 🎨 **Brand icons updated** — `workspai.png` and `workspai.svg` updated to current Workspai identity; stale `rapidkits.svg` removed.

### Fixed

- 🛡️ **AI module slug validation** — module slugs returned by AI are validated against the live module list and the `vendor/category/slug` regex before being applied, preventing hallucinated module names from reaching the CLI.
- 📐 **AI project context enrichment** — context payload now includes `python_version`, `rapidkit_cli_version`, `rapidkit_core_version`, `installed_modules`, `workspace_health`, `runtime`, and `engine` fields so the model has complete environment awareness.



### Changed

- 🧭 **Workspai positioning sync** across the extension README, Marketplace description, and webview header so public-facing messaging consistently uses the canonical product line: "The AI workspace for backend teams"
- 🐹 **Go AI guidance** in `aiService` now explains the current Go support boundary more clearly: supported kits are `gofiber.standard` and `gogin.standard`, and Go projects should be extended with native Go packages and internal adapters rather than RapidKit marketplace modules
- 🏷️ **Go kit metadata cleanup** — removed misleading `modular` tags from Go/Fiber and Go/Gin kit descriptors

### Fixed

- 🧠 **Workspace memory action icon restored** — `rapidkit.editWorkspaceMemory` now uses a valid codicon so the inline edit-memory action renders visibly in the WORKSPACES sidebar instead of leaving only an empty clickable area
- 🪟 **Platform-safe npm wrapper execution** — `buildRapidkitCommand()` now forces package resolution through `npx --yes --package rapidkit rapidkit ...`, preventing local launcher shadowing from the current working directory
- 🐹 **Go framework detection** — `workspaceDetector` now detects `gofiber.standard` and `gogin.standard` from real `go.mod` dependencies instead of RapidKit-specific package strings, with regression tests added for both frameworks
- 🩺 **`rapidkit-core` verification reliability** — setup panel checks now use `pip show` / `pipx list` based verification paths that are more stable across Windows and Linux environments
- 🎼 **Poetry verification robustness** — setup panel now probes real Poetry executable candidates only when they actually exist, reducing noisy or misleading verification failures

## [0.19.0] - 2026-04-18

### Added

- 🤖 **AI model selector** in the AI modal header — users can choose any Copilot-registered language model (Claude, GPT, Gemini, etc.) from a compact inline dropdown before sending a query. Premium users see their full model list; free-tier users see what's available to them.
- 🧠 **Thinking indicator** while the AI context-scan phase runs — animated bouncing dots replace the blank waiting state so users have clear feedback before the first token arrives.
- 📝 **MarkdownRenderer component** (`webview-ui/src/components/MarkdownRenderer.tsx`) — lightweight zero-dependency markdown renderer for AI responses supporting headings, bold/italic, inline code, fenced code blocks, ordered/unordered lists, and HR rules.

### Changed

- ⚡ **Real-time AI streaming** — fixed the "all at once" delivery problem. Extension host now flushes chunk batches every 50 ms via `setInterval`, breaking VS Code IPC batching that was holding tokens until stream completion.
- 🎨 **Streaming render path** — `MarkdownRenderer` no longer runs `parseBlocks` on every animation frame during streaming. Raw text is displayed instantly during the stream; a single parse pass runs after completion for formatted output.
- 🗂️ **Quick-prompt chips** hidden while streaming/thinking to reduce visual noise.
- 🔧 **`collapseAll` tree view** switched to native `showCollapseAll: true` on the `rapidkitProjects` view contribution — removes the invalid `workbench.actions.treeView.rapidkitProjects.collapseAll` menu entry warning.

### Fixed

- 🐛 **Menu item warning** — `workbench.actions.treeView.rapidkitProjects.collapseAll` was referenced in `menus` but not registered in `commands`; resolved by using VS Code's built-in `showCollapseAll` view property.

## [0.18.0] - 2026-04-17

### Added

- 🧠 **Deep AI project context** in `aiService` for FastAPI/NestJS/Go workspaces with richer framework and file-signal extraction before generation and debugging.
- ✅ **New AI regression coverage** with dedicated tests for alias/model handling and AI debugger command flow.

### Changed

- 🤖 **Model selection hardening** for GitHub Models/Copilot chat models, including robust alias resolution and safer fallback ordering.
- 🧵 **Workspace memory I/O migrated to async flow** to avoid blocking extension interactions.
- 🎛️ **AI interaction consistency** by routing legacy debug/brain entry points through the shared Workspai AI modal pipeline.

### Fixed

- 🛡️ **Prompt budget safeguards** to prevent oversized AI prompts and reduce timeout/failure risk on large repositories.
- 🧩 **Module slug typo auto-correction** with conservative matching to reduce failed module operations from minor naming mistakes.
- 🔁 **Webview AI request lifecycle stability** with stronger request correlation/cancel behavior across panel and modal flows.

## [0.17.1] - 2026-04-17

### Performance

- **WORKSPACES sidebar — two-phase rendering** (`workspaceExplorer`) — `getChildren()` previously blocked on three per-workspace async ops: `versionService.getVersionInfo()` (subprocess + pip network call, 5 s timeout), `getBootstrapProfile()` (disk read), and `_countInstalledModules()` (recursive registry.json scan). Items now render instantly from cache; metadata (version badge, profile, module count) loads in background via `_scheduleBackgroundMetadataLoad` and fills in without user action.
- **PROJECTS sidebar — two-phase rendering** (`projectExplorer`) — `getChildren()` now returns items immediately from `this.projects` cache and schedules `_scheduleProjectLoad()` in background; `loadProjects()` uses `Promise.all` for parallel `pathExists` checks per project instead of a sequential if/else chain.
- **AVAILABLE MODULES — two-phase rendering** (`moduleExplorer`) — `getChildren()` immediately returns a `loading~spin` spinner item and fires `_scheduleBackgroundCatalogLoad()` instead of `await`-ing `_ensureCatalogLoaded()` (which ran a subprocess on cache miss). Catalog fills in when background load completes.
- **Extension activation** — `workspaceDetector.detectRapidKitProjects()` is no longer `await`-ed at activation; fires in background with `.catch()` — extension activates without blocking on workspace detection.
- **`coreVersionService` TTL** — version cache TTL extended from 5 min → 30 min. Python package version changes rarely; the subprocess version check runs far less often.
- **`examplesService` timeout** — axios request timeout reduced from 10 s → 5 s.

### Fixed

- **AVAILABLE MODULES empty state** — `getChildren()` now returns `[]` when no project is selected, allowing the VS Code `viewsWelcome` rich empty state to show (icon + heading + description + button) instead of a bare placeholder tree item.
- **Removed fragile `setTimeout` for doctor refresh** — two `setTimeout(5000)` / `setTimeout(8000)` calls after doctor re-run and autofix have been removed. The file watcher on `doctor-last-run.json` already handles refresh automatically.
- **`HeroAction.tsx` badge alignment** — `$(sparkle)` icon inside `.hero-badge` span now aligns inline with text (`inline-flex items-center gap-1` / `display: inline-flex`).
- **Dead code removed** — `_ensureCatalogLoaded()` in `moduleExplorer` deleted; it was no longer called after two-phase refactor.

### Changed

- `package.json` — `viewsWelcome` for `rapidkitModules` updated with icon `$(package)`, heading, description, and an "Open Projects" link button (shown when `!rapidkit:projectSelected`).
- `package.json` — `concurrently` added to `devDependencies` (was used in `dev` script but missing from declared deps).

### Added

- ✦ **AI Debug Actions (Code Actions)** — `✦ Debug with Workspai AI` and `✦ Explain error with AI` quick-fix actions appear in the editor lightbulb for Python, TypeScript, JavaScript, and Go files that have diagnostics or a text selection; opens the AI modal with the error/selection pre-filled in Debug mode
- ✦ **Doctor Fix with AI** — each issue in the **Workspace Health** sidebar panel now has a ✨ inline button; clicking it opens the AI modal with the full issue context pre-filled, ready for analysis
- ✦ **AI Module Suggestions** — the Create Project modal now has a "Suggest modules with AI" button that recommends the top modules for your chosen framework and project description
- **Minimizable AI Create modal** — a `−` minimize button appears during `thinking` and `creating` steps; the modal collapses to a floating pill in the bottom-left corner so the dashboard stays usable; auto-restores when creation completes

### Changed

- **Quick Actions sidebar** — consolidated to a single `✦ AI Assistant` button (`$(sparkle)` icon) that opens the AI modal; redundant "Workspace Brain" button removed
- **`rapidkit.debugWithAI` command** — now opens the main Workspai panel AI modal instead of a separate HTML tab; context (editor selection or diagnostics) is passed as `prefillQuestion`
- **`rapidkit.workspaceBrain` command** — now focuses the main Workspai panel instead of opening a separate HTML tab
- **Doctor Fix with AI** — removed scratch-doc workaround; issue text is now passed directly as `prefillQuestion` to the AI modal

### Fixed

- `AIModal.tsx` — added `context` to `useEffect` dependency array so that `prefillQuestion` is correctly applied even when the modal is already mounted with a previous context



### Added

- ✦ **AI actions on workspace cards** — each workspace in the Recent Workspaces list now has a `✦` button (visible on hover) that opens the AI modal pre-loaded with that workspace's context
- ✦ **AI actions on module cards** — each module card in the Module Browser now has a `✦` button that opens the AI modal with the module's context (Module Advisor)
- **`aiForWorkspace` / `aiForModule` webview messages** handled in `WelcomePanel` — routes to `showAIModal()` with correct context type

### Fixed

- **Critical: `command 'rapidkit.workspaceSelected' already exists`** — removed duplicate `registerCommand` call from `ProjectExplorer` constructor; command is now registered only once in `extension.ts`
- `projectExplorer.setWorkspace()` is now correctly called when `rapidkit.workspaceSelected` fires (previously only `doctorEvidenceExplorer.refresh()` was called)

## [0.16.0] - 2026-03-22

### Added

- 🩺 **Doctor Evidence Viewer** (`DoctorEvidenceProvider` tree view)
  - New `WORKSPACE HEALTH` panel in the RapidKit sidebar activity bar

- 📦 **Module install modal from Available Modules sidebar**
  - New command `rapidkit.showModuleInstallModal`
  - Clicking a module in the sidebar opens the `InstallModuleModal` (same as welcome page cards)
  - New webview message `openModuleInstallModal` handled in `App.tsx`
  - `WelcomePanel.showModuleInstallModal()` static method + `_pendingModuleModal` queue

### Changed

- 🧩 `WelcomePanel` gains `setExtensionContext()` static method so sidebar components can open the panel without passing context
- 🔄 Initial workspace path sync: after `workspaceExplorer.refresh()` on activation, health panel is immediately seeded with the auto-selected workspace

## [0.15.0] - 2026-02-27

  - Improved contrast and focus states for dark/light themes

- 🌐 **Example workspaces behavior**
  - External links are opened via extension host (not direct webview popups)

- 🧠 **Workspace vs project state handling in modules UI**
  - Module cards/install actions now require selected **project** (not just workspace)
  - Module install/update gating aligned with project selection semantics

### Fixed

- 🐛 **Example cards link/clone regressions**
  - Fixed broken external open behavior from webview

  - `WelcomePanel.openWorkspaceModal()` static method with `__workspace__` pending-modal token
  - `rapidkit.openWorkspaceModal` command registered in extension

- 🚫 **Modules Disabled for Go Projects**
  - Sidebar AVAILABLE MODULES shows info banner instead of module list when Go project selected
  - Welcome Page ModuleBrowser renders Go-specific banner; search/filters hidden

  - Fixed in `rapidkitCLI.ts`, `kitsService.ts`, `firstTimeSetup.ts`, `updateChecker.ts`, `doctor.ts`, `checkSystem.ts`
  - Prevents npm registry version (stale) from overriding local version and breaking `create workspace` / `create project`

- 🔧 **Go Project Init Detection**
  - `rapidkit.projectDev` now checks `go.sum` (not `node_modules`) for Go projects
  - Default port for Go projects set to `3000`; uses `npx rapidkit dev` instead of `npm run start:dev`

- 🎯 **Simpler**: No Python/Poetry installation required
- ⚡ **5-6x Faster**: Direct npm execution vs Python environment setup
- 🔄 **Consistent**: Single source of truth (npm package) for templates
- 🐛 **Fewer bugs**: Less complexity = fewer edge cases
- 📦 **Smaller**: Removed bundled templates (managed by npm package)
- 🎨 **Better UX**: Smart defaults, no annoying dialogs, professional UI

### Migration Notes

- **For Users**: Extension now requires Node.js/npm (already available in VS Code)
- **For Developers**: Python RapidKit CLI no longer needed for development
- **Workspaces**: Existing workspaces continue to work, new API for creation
- **Templates**: Managed by npm package, always up-to-date
- **Custom Locations**: Now fully supported with marker files

### Technical Details

- Updated `RapidKitCLI` class with new methods:
  - `createWorkspace(options)`: Workspace creation with `--yes` flag
  - `createProject(options)`: Standalone project creation with `--yes` flag
  - `createProjectInWorkspace(options)`: Project inside workspace with `--yes` flag
- Enhanced `WorkspaceManager.isRapidKitWorkspace()` to check both `.rapidkit/` and marker files
- Refactored all command handlers to use new CLI API
- Updated TypeScript types to match new simplified workflow
- Removed legacy Python CLI integration code
- Added marker file creation for custom locations
