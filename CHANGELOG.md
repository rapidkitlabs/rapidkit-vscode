# Changelog

All notable changes to the **Workspai** extension (formerly RapidKit) will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.44.0] - 2026-08-23

### Added

- Added deterministic 360° Workspace Graph GIF export. The extension freezes
  the current bounded graph revision, captures a 60-frame multi-axis 3D path
  with depth and architecture-ring cues, encodes a seamless looping GIF locally,
  and saves it through a governed VS Code dialog.
- Upgraded the Graph camera from two-axis yaw/pitch movement to a persistent
  three-axis orbit with roll. Circular pointer gestures rotate the graph plane,
  while Shift-drag and Q/E provide explicit roll control.
- Made 3D the default Graph view and expanded GIF capture to a smooth 60-frame
  multi-axis camera path: two complete azimuth revolutions, complementary upper
  and lower elevations, and restrained bidirectional roll. Export no longer
  inherits a single fixed viewing latitude from the interactive camera.
- Raised Graph GIF output to a presentation-ready 960×540 canvas and slowed the
  complete orbit to six seconds. Every frame now fits the full projected graph
  into a safe margin, while collision-aware labels, quieter depth edges, and a
  subtle branded backdrop keep exports readable across documentation and social
  platforms.
- Added persistent Architecture, Globe, Brain, and Constellation 3D projections.
  Each preset deterministically reprojects the same bounded canonical entities
  and relationships, and 360° GIF export now captures the workspace-selected
  shape instead of reverting to a separate export layout.
- Replaced the fixed RGB332 GIF palette with a frame-derived adaptive palette,
  perceptual color matching, and restrained ordered dithering. Dark VS Code
  surfaces, antialiased nodes, labels, and graph accent colors now remain much
  closer to the live dashboard, while the 360° orbit uses a calm 12-second
  presentation pace.
- Rebuilt the Brain projection as an anatomical semantic silhouette: a folded
  elongated cortex with separated hemispheres, a corrugated lower-rear
  cerebellum, and a tapered control-plane stem. Brain-specific gyral guides now
  replace architecture rings, and its default camera opens on a recognizable
  side profile while retaining full three-axis orbit and GIF capture.
- Added an export-time GIF pace selector with Fast (6s), Standard (8.4s), Calm
  (12s), and Slow (18s) loops. The selected delay is bound to the immutable
  capture request while all presets retain the same 60-angle coverage.
- Matched GIF framing more closely to the live dashboard by reducing capture
  padding from 12% to a still-safe 6%, giving dense nodes more effective pixels.
  Ordered dithering is now limited to brighter chromatic pixels so neutral dark
  surfaces remain smooth instead of acquiring a visible texture.
- Added HQ 360° MP4 export for dashboard-faithful output. The selected semantic
  shape and pace are rendered through the same deterministic 60-angle camera,
  then encoded directly from true-color canvas frames through a high-bitrate
  H.264 pipeline with deterministic timestamps and MP4 fast-start. The extension
  validates the MP4 container, workspace scope, and 64 MB limit before presenting
  a governed save dialog.
- Rebuilt Constellation as deterministic project asterisms distributed through
  real 3D depth instead of random clusters on a planar ring. Added a Workspai
  projection sampled from the official SVG silhouette, including its detached
  signal square, official purple-to-teal color progression, front-facing camera,
  semantic outline, persisted selection, and identical dashboard/GIF/MP4 layout.
- Matched the capture backdrop to the live 3D surface: the same centered cyan
  glow, lower-left violet accent, dark editor base, and restrained edge vignette
  are now rasterized into GIF and HQ video frames instead of using the earlier
  stronger blue export-only treatment.
- Enabled dashboard Auto Orbit by default and raised its rotation rate by about
  44% for a more legible sense of depth, while preserving the operating-system
  reduced-motion preference.
- Moved Graph quality, coverage, provider, binding, and diagnostics detail behind
  one compact evidence summary so the interactive graph remains above the
  initial dashboard fold without removing governed detail.

### Fixed

- Made 360° GIF export visibly acknowledge every click, including WebGL2
  fallback, frame progress, encoding, validation, and save failures. The Export
  menu no longer exposes a silently disabled GIF action.
- Removed WebGL2 as a functional dependency for 3D Graph and GIF export. VS Code
  windows without GPU-backed WebGL now use the same radial layout, three-axis
  camera, depth sorting, labels, orbit guides, and capture pipeline through a
  Canvas2D software renderer.

- Routed missing or stale project lifecycle evidence through project-scoped
  governed `init`, `test`, `build`, and `start` producers before Verify, so
  Sidebar Studio, card handoff, and native Chat advance the causal queue from
  fresh CLI artifacts instead of falling back to generic commands.
- Reserved `run-workspace-command` for project-native tools. Workspai commands
  are rejected across package runners and must use the registered command
  surface backed by the bundled CLI runtime.
- Made source fingerprints independent of Workspai reports, repair state,
  generated caches, dependencies, and build output. Autonomous diagnostics now
  work in repositories without a first commit and no longer stop on large
  `.workspai/cache` files or evidence refreshes.

## [0.43.0] - 2026-08-22

### Added

- Added a model-driven Create intent router that understands the active Create
  surface, canonical workspace ownership, current target, selected scope, and
  the executable kit capability contract before any plan or mutation begins.
  Greetings, product questions, ambiguous requests, adopt/import requests, and
  existing-source work now follow distinct, bounded paths instead of becoming
  an arbitrary scaffold plan.
- Added conversational Create guidance with one explicit next action. The user
  can clarify in the same session, switch the authoritative workspace/project
  target, open adopt/import, or hand an existing-source request to governed
  Agent without losing the original request.
- Added a bounded Create capability host. Before proposing a plan, the model
  must inspect the portable Create context and canonical executable capability
  contract; it can request architecture guidance and then submit exactly one
  non-mutating plan proposal.
- Added controller-owned `execute-approved-create-plan` orchestration for new
  workspaces, projects in the active user-selected workspace, optional
  companion projects, Workspace Intelligence synchronization, and project-view
  refresh. Raw workspace, project, package-manager, and sync mutations are not
  exposed to the model.
- Added an integrity-checked Workspai CLI runtime to the VSIX. First-run Create,
  adopt, intelligence, Doctor, Graph, Agent, and Goal operations no longer
  depend on a global CLI or the shared mutable `npx` cache.
- Added one typed, single-flight workspace-creation operation for AI Create and
  manual sidebar Create. Retry remains bound to the same validated creation
  plan, while technical diagnostics stay in the Workspai Output channel.

### Fixed

- Made Dashboard evidence generation-atomic and dependency-aware. A governed
  artifact write patches its owning card plus cards whose freshness depends on
  it; unknown orchestration or transaction state falls back to a complete
  snapshot. Studio rebinds its card after every producer, CLI transaction, or
  verification result, so Dashboard and chat cannot retain different blocker
  generations.
- Bound stale-evidence repair to the exact upstream producer. Doctor, Analyze,
  Readiness, Pipeline, Contract, Model, Impact, Context, and related producer
  failures refresh their canonical artifact before verification; real source
  and runtime findings continue through the causal remediation queue instead of
  looping on aggregate Verify.
- Rebound Sidebar and native Chat handoffs to current Dashboard evidence before
  constructing a model session. Persisted sessions whose blocker signature no
  longer matches are not resumed against obsolete evidence.
- Completed the dependency-security capability plane for card-bound Agent
  sessions while hiding unsupported tools from free-form hosts. The model now
  sees only executable tools and can inspect, repair, upgrade, close, and verify
  a CLI-owned dependency transaction without dead-tool retries.
- Made Review and Undo transaction-safe. Review failures are visible, Undo is
  bound to the exact workspace and session, controls are disabled while a
  repair owns source, historical steps cannot be undone, and hydrated rollback
  state removes reverted files and invalidates prior completion.
- Kept explicit Agent authority intact for question-shaped input. Informational
  questions remain read-only by policy, while explicit fix, change, create,
  implement, remove, and repair requests retain the full governed Agent loop.
- Fixed stale or missing evidence cards entering a source-mutation loop. Sidebar
  Studio and native Chat now rebuild and consume the CLI-authored causal
  remediation queue before involving the model; only a genuine unresolved
  source cause widens into governed source repair. Resume continues from the
  refreshed queue instead of repeating a no-op card-wide transaction.
- Removed duplicate Explain, Why, and Trace entries from the Repair queue. These
  derived artifacts remain available for inspection, while the canonical
  producer card owns repair. Primary card copy now hides raw timestamps and
  presents concise evidence guidance, with full diagnostics kept behind details.
- Replaced long npm package-runner commands in Workspai terminals with the
  ordinary `workspai ...` command surface. Each terminal is still bound to the
  integrity-checked CLI embedded in the extension, so shorter commands do not
  depend on a global installation or weaken version guarantees.
- Fixed ordinary Create-tab messages such as greetings or questions being
  coerced into a default FastAPI creation plan. Planning now requires an
  explicit, high-confidence create intent and a self-contained brief assembled
  from the bounded Create conversation.
- Bound every AI creation approval to an expiring SHA-256 plan digest, immutable
  Create session, and target-aware destination. A new workspace is independent
  of volatile sidebar selection, while a new project is locked to the active
  user-selected canonical workspace. Edited, stale, replayed, concurrent, or
  cross-workspace approvals fail closed with an actionable re-draft path.
- Prevented asynchronous scope hydration or an older conversation from silently
  changing an explicit Workspace/Project selector choice. Project plans now
  display their actual active-workspace destination instead of an unused model
  workspace suggestion; workspace plans explicitly state that their proposed
  workspace will be created before the first project.
- Restricted automatic Create retries to failures proven to occur before source
  mutation. Generator, partial-workspace, and post-create verification failures
  now require review and a fresh plan instead of replaying a possibly partial
  scaffold.
- Kept host installation policy out of model proposals. AI Create now delegates
  Python bootstrap selection to the verified runtime's `auto` policy, preventing
  a valid product plan from failing because the model selected an unavailable
  local installer such as pipx.
- Prevented Create conversation responses from echoing the user's message or
  returning generic model identity disclaimers; social turns now remain concise
  and native to the Create experience.
- Separated application topology from runtime profile selection. Delegated
  full-stack plans now prefer the portable Next.js + NestJS `node-only` lane;
  `polyglot` is reserved for genuinely different runtime families or an
  explicit multi-runtime request, while explicitly requested frameworks remain
  authoritative.
- Python-required AI Create plans now validate Python version and venv support
  before workspace mutation. Missing prerequisites return one actionable,
  portable Create result instead of opening a nested modal or collapsing into a
  generic creation failure.
- Removed the duplicate frontend capability probe from packaged Create
  execution. Workspace and project scaffolding now share the same
  integrity-checked bundled CLI authority, so a transient secondary probe
  cannot reject a runtime that just created the workspace.
- Added an Electron-aware launcher for the embedded CLI. Commander now receives
  Node-style arguments inside the packaged VS Code Extension Host, preventing
  Doctor and other valid commands from being reported as missing capabilities.
- Unified CLI authority across background execution, capability probes, Studio,
  Dashboard, and user-visible terminal commands. Internal operations use the
  integrity-bound runtime, terminal commands use the exact CLI release verified
  by the extension contract, and composed gates present one actionable error at
  the UI boundary instead of duplicate capability notifications.
- Decoupled the optional Python engine from the `polyglot` profile. AI Create
  installs it only when the approved plan contains a Python-backed project;
  Node-only polyglot and enterprise workspaces can remain lightweight.
- Removed duplicated framework-to-kit inventories from AI planning. Routing,
  tool schemas, normalization, and execution now project one canonical scaffold
  capability map.
- Fixed first-run AI Create failing with npm `ENOTEMPTY` after the managed
  Workspai directory had been removed. Internal CLI execution is now isolated
  from npm cache races and verified against the extension release policy.
- Fixed AI Create continuing into project scaffolding after the nested
  `workspai.createWorkspace` command had swallowed the real failure and then
  reporting a misleading local workspace path.
- Removed synthetic fallback workspaces. A creation result is successful only
  after canonical workspace markers pass verification; otherwise Create stops
  with a portable, actionable error and leaves project scaffolding untouched.
- Derived every Create profile, executable kit, runtime candidate, default kit,
  and Python-engine decision from the CLI-published Create Planner contract.
  The extension no longer maintains a second creation architecture that can
  drift from the CLI.
- Renamed the explicit post-create Bootstrap action to Initialize dependencies
  and kept it separate from Create. New workspaces and projects finish with
  synchronized canonical intelligence; dependency installation and strict
  verification run only when the user requests those lifecycle operations.

### Security

- The packaged CLI runtime has an exact SHA-256 file inventory, rejects
  traversal and symbolic links, fails closed when missing or incompatible, and
  carries generated third-party notices and license files in the VSIX.

## [0.42.0] - 2026-08-21

### Added

- Added a session-level changed-file summary to the assistant transcript. One
  card reports how many files the agent edited with cumulative `+added -removed`
  totals, lists each file with its own counts, progressively discloses the
  remainder, and offers Review and Undo bound to the owning CLI transaction.
- Added `Review`, which opens every comparable file of a change set in one
  native multi-file comparison and reports any file it had to skip.
- Added a read-only `workspai-repair` document scheme so a native comparison
  reads the transaction's own checkpoint content instead of an untitled copy.
  The modified side is now the real file, so it can be edited from the diff.
- Added line-number gutters to inline repair diffs, with original numbering on
  removed lines and new numbering on added lines.

### Fixed

- Fixed understated `+added -removed` badges. Counts came from the diff preview,
  which is truncated for transport, so any change larger than the preview
  reported too few lines. The host now reports authoritative totals.
- Fixed a completed Undo leaving reverted files listed as changed, and leaving
  the per-step Undo control enabled in free-form Agent sessions. A rolled-back
  transaction is now retired across every session and incident surface.

### Changed

- Aligned the extension runtime and published contract mirrors with Workspai
  CLI 0.63.0. The extension now requires that release because aggregate repair
  queues and immutable causal-finding handoffs are execution requirements, not
  optional presentation metadata.
- Unified aggregate-card repair around a deterministic sequential causal queue.
  Studio repairs one blocking finding family in one canonical project per CLI
  transaction, refreshes the exact owning producer, then advances using fresh
  evidence. Advisory findings cannot widen mutation scope, and unrelated
  workspace blockers do not reopen a resolved selected card.
- Added structured causal finding targets to Doctor, Analyze, Readiness,
  Workspace Verify, Workspace Run, and Workspace Intelligence handoffs so an
  aggregate card is never mistaken for a source file or mutation target.
- Added a model-driven, tool-free intent router before project bootstrap, Goal
  planning, scope selection, or source mutation. Casual conversation and
  clarification now complete as normal chat; explicit Goal mode binds any
  clear bounded engineering task or durable outcome to governed planning.
- Added an immutable execution policy derived from selected mode and classified
  request intent. The policy is persisted across resume and controls the model
  prompt, tool registry, mutation authority, and verification requirement from
  one contract.
- Added explicit, dismissible mode suggestions such as `Continue in Agent`,
  `Run with Agent`, and `Track as Goal`. Read-only authority may be reduced
  automatically, but increased authority always requires a user click.
- Removed implicit Agent-to-Goal promotion. Goal-like requests submitted in
  Agent mode remain one-shot governed Agent tasks, while card handoffs and
  durable in-progress sessions retain their existing canonical route.
- Replaced Goal cancellation errors with a quiet completed state and preserved
  arbitrary bounded outcomes instead of presenting Goal as numeric-only.
- Project bootstrap now accepts both the legacy Model/Graph evidence route and
  the canonical bounded Skill/Graph route while requiring the CLI 0.63.0
  causal-repair contract for mutating workflows.
- Made Studio, native Chat, Copilot handoff, and Webview agent context follow
  the CLI-authored canonical read order: report index, active Goal and Goal
  Pack, bounded context, relevant operational Skill, then bounded Graph search.
- Removed full Workspace Model and Knowledge Graph exports from default model
  prompts; complete exports remain available for explicit audit workflows.
- Added bounded dynamic operational-Skill selection. Every validated canonical
  Skill remains tool-readable, while at most three task-relevant Skills are
  preloaded into a model prompt.

### Security

- Unified file-deletion authorization across free-form Agent, Sidebar card
  handoff, and native Chat. Every deletion now requires an explicitly inspected,
  unchanged regular file and passes workspace/project normalization, protected
  path policy, symlink refusal, SHA revalidation, and the CLI Repair Engine.
- Expanded cross-runtime source-mutation detection for scaffold, initialization,
  generation, migration, wrapper, and creation commands so project generators
  cannot run through the non-mutating command capability plane.
- Made intent-driven authority fail closed: only high-confidence engineering
  classifications can enter Agent or Goal mutation loops, persisted execution
  policies are canonically revalidated on resume, and invalid UI mode payloads
  fall back to read-only Ask instead of Agent.
- Strengthened operational-Skill index validation for timestamps, input hashes,
  unique identifiers, canonical paths, and schema metadata before Studio can
  expose generated Skill files to a model.
- Kept portable workspace identity in Studio evidence and continued blocking
  machine-local paths from source, tests, documentation, and packaged output.

## [0.41.0] - 2026-08-19

### Added

- Enriched agent context consumption with impact, doctor, analyze, readiness,
  verify, explain, and diff summaries from CLI 0.61.0.
- Added replan decision option in repair decision UI, letting the model discard
  a failed plan and generate a fresh proposal for the same target.
- Free-form agent sessions now use a preflight turn to understand user intent
  before executing tools, with clarification pause for vague requests.
- Minimal, enterprise-level chat UI redesign with refined typography, colors,
  spacing, empty states, and error displays.
- Dashboard card and artifact tab optimization for responsive, minimal layout.

### Changed

- Aligned all extension contracts with CLI 0.61.0 (repair transaction, repair
  capabilities, analyze, extension-cli-compatibility).
- Enhanced system prompt for agent mode to promote intent understanding before
  tool use and allow plain-text clarification messages.
- Refined sidebar, composer, and session bar CSS for professional appearance.

## [0.40.0] - Unreleased

### Added

- Native governed Goal planning from Dashboard Intelligence, Command Palette,
  workspace context menus, and `@workspai /goal` in VS Code Chat.
- CLI-owned Goal lifecycle review for activation, preparation, verification,
  cancellation, canonical Goal Pack inspection, and bounded agent handoff.
- Active Goal grounding in Ask, Plan, Agent, and Incident Studio prompts using
  the validated CLI-authored handoff rather than directory scans or timestamps.
- Active Goal context in the primary workspace sidebar with selected-workspace
  file watching for immediate lifecycle refresh.
- A dedicated **Goal** composer mode alongside Agent, Ask, and Plan. It binds
  arbitrary bounded engineering outcomes to the CLI Goal Pack lifecycle before
  exposing mutation tools and links every repair transaction to the active
  Goal. Deterministic categories close only through exact Goal verification;
  other categories require an evidence-backed outcome review plus canonical
  workspace verification and are never mislabeled as machine-verified.
- Evidence-first graph query, bounded source-range reads, and exact-context
  edit tools shared by Sidebar and native Chat repair sessions.
- Canonical-first project bootstrap for Chat, Studio, Agent, and Goal sessions.
  Adopted projects now resolve and validate the CLI-authored portable entry
  receipt before broad source discovery, while raw projects remain available.

### Changed

- Added canonical Goal scope selection for multi-project workspaces. Studio now
  offers one project, a project set, or the whole workspace, then binds
  polyglot coverage to a runtime already present in the CLI Workspace Model.
  Every selection is replayed through explicit `--scope` and `--runtime`
  arguments before Goal activation; cancellation never exposes mutation tools.
- Routed measurable Agent requests through the same CLI-authored Goal Pack
  lifecycle as Goal mode, removing the extension's parallel verified-goal
  planning path and preserving CLI decisions for polyglot coverage scopes.
- Limited Goal activation actions to `ready-to-plan` entries and exposed
  clarification, evidence, and blocker states as review actions instead.
- Added a defense-in-depth runtime-binding check so a polyglot coverage plan
  produced by an older CLI cannot reach mutation without one selected runtime.
- Enforced ASCII English across authored extension source, webview code, tests,
  fixtures, documentation, release material, and filenames through pre-commit,
  lint, CI packaging, and prepublication guards.
- Promoted the CLI 0.60 Goal Pack, Goal Index, agent handoff, plan result, and
  lifecycle result contracts from mirrored placeholders to guarded runtime and
  evidence consumers.
- Promoted the CLI 0.60 project-entry and agent-bootstrap receipt schemas to
  runtime consumers and added the same preflight to the local polyglot E2E
  qualification plan.
- Added Goal creation and status commands to the Dashboard CLI reference while
  preserving the CLI as the sole lifecycle, verification, and rollback owner.
- Routed workspace-scoped blocker cards to their single affected canonical
  project, including linked projects, while keeping evidence refresh and source
  mutation ownership separate.
- Unified Sidebar and native Chat repair continuation around one project-bound
  durable controller, typed CLI transaction disposition, and card-specific
  repair policy.
- Made producer-owned cards refresh their exact producer deterministically
  without spending a model call or exposing source-mutation tools.
- Required Agent completion to include a post-transaction changed-file review
  and final CLI verification, while Ask and Plan remain evidence-backed,
  bounded, read-only modes.
- Enforced immutable Goal attempt budgets in both the extension controller and
  CLI lifecycle, including deterministic closure when the baseline already
  satisfies the requested target.
- Restored Goal execution progress from both durable verification attempts and
  CLI-linked repair history, and accepted post-repair source state only through
  a current, integrity-bound closed Goal transaction.
- Replaced exact runtime workspace and project roots with portable `$WORKSPACE`
  and `$PROJECT` identities across model prompts, conversation history, tool
  calls, and tool results while preserving useful project-relative evidence.
- Split compatibility ownership so the CLI remains authoritative for published
  schemas while each extension release owns its minimum and verified CLI
  versions. New extension requirements no longer force a redundant CLI release.

### Fixed

- Renewed legacy stale Goal sessions through the CLI with their original
  objective, selected scope, and runtime instead of stopping the Studio loop.
- Rebuilt a remediation plan once when its canonical blocker evidence advances
  during selection, while retaining causal retry bounds for model-driven calls.
- Gave project-native test, build, and dependency validation a governed
  ten-minute budget and now reports timeout or termination signals explicitly.
- Parsed versioned CLI operation errors into concise, redacted user guidance
  instead of rendering raw JSON in Sidebar sessions.
- Surfaced the Goal Pack's canonical decision question and measurement
  prerequisites when Studio pauses before mutation.
- Corrected cross-product claim parity to compare the extension's default-kit
  setting with executable native and official create-planner entries instead
  of the narrower runtime scaffold subset.
- Fixed cancelled and rolled-back CLI repairs being presented as pending user
  decisions, and deduplicated repeated protected-evidence explanations.
- Fixed linked-project repair receipts and native diffs so changed files are
  presented project-relative while the extension host retains the exact
  transaction boundary.
- Returned a failed, rolled-back exact-target verification to another bounded
  source attempt instead of misclassifying it as success, cancellation, or a
  decision that the CLI did not publish.
- Prevented durable sessions from restoring or receiving steering in another
  linked project that happens to share the same workspace and card id.
- Canonicalized project-relative and workspace-relative source proposals to one
  selected-project boundary and rejected sibling traversal before CLI handoff.
- Rejected supposedly diagnostic workspace commands when their before/after Git
  fingerprints prove a tracked or untracked source mutation.
- Prevented Goal metric gaming by rejecting deletion in deterministic verified
  Goals and limiting test-coverage mutations to test-owned source, fixtures,
  and snapshots. General Goal Packs retain inspected, rollback-protected file
  deletion when the objective genuinely requires it.
- Required explicit runtime capabilities for integrity-bound Goal source
  transitions and durable serialized attempt budgets before Studio may publish
  a Goal mutation proposal.

### Security

- Pinned PostCSS's transitive Nano ID runtime to 3.3.18, closing the
  zero-size custom-generator denial-of-service advisory in the development
  dependency graph.
- Goal artifacts are accepted only through canonical workspace-relative paths;
  absolute paths, traversal, incompatible schemas, mismatched fingerprints,
  and unsafe handoff identities fail closed before reaching UI or model context.
- Prevented inspected canonical `.workspai` state from becoming model-owned
  source authority, and removed raw CLI transaction/checkpoint filesystem
  identity from Webview messages.
- Replaced absolute workspace/project paths in Studio, evidence-card, and
  structured incident prompts with `$WORKSPACE`, `$PROJECT`, and portable
  artifact references before context can reach a model provider.
- Required linked-project model proposals to prove the CLI's registered-root,
  hash-pinned proposal, and verification-receipt capabilities before any
  external source mutation can begin.
- Fail-closed adopted-project mutation when its portable entry contract is
  missing, degraded, blocked, schema-incompatible, or contains an absolute
  machine-local path.
- Centralized source-candidate filtering across Sidebar, native Chat, and
  durable replay so `.workspai`, `.rapidkit`, and lockfiles are excluded with
  both POSIX and Windows path separators.

### Compatibility

- Extension baseline: Workspai CLI 0.60.0+ with the advertised top-level `goal`
  capability. Older CLIs receive an actionable version/capability gate instead
  of a parsed terminal fallback.

### Verification

- Canonical contract generation and CLI/extension mirror parity passed against
  Workspai CLI 0.60.0. The extension fails closed on older CLIs before using
  project-set scope or canonical runtime-selection contracts.
- Host/Webview type checking passed; 389 test files and 2,854 tests passed, with
  one file and five tests explicitly skipped.
- All 22 enterprise scenarios passed; production build and VSIX inspection
  passed for a 173-file, 6.05 MB `rapidkit-vscode-0.40.0.vsix` package.
- The high-severity dependency audit gate passed with zero high or critical
  findings.

See [`releases/RELEASE_NOTES_v0.40.0.md`](releases/RELEASE_NOTES_v0.40.0.md).

## [0.39.0] - 2026-08-11

### Added

- Native `@workspai /repair` support in VS Code Chat, including canonical
  blocker selection, streamed CLI Repair Engine progress, portable changed-file
  receipts, and transaction-bound decision buttons.
- Native source-repair continuation backed by the shared durable
  `StudioAgentSession`, selected-model tool calling, inspected-source
  authorization, CLI-owned patch transactions, cancellation, and tool activity.
- Canonical Doctor evidence projection for diagnosis, summary, receipt,
  validation, capability, freshness, applicability, and repair disposition.
- One CLI-authored Workspace Intelligence artifact catalog shared by
  Assistant, Dashboard, Studio, and blocker handoff.
- Explicit Assistant evidence objectives that disclose freshness and bound
  Ask, Plan, and Agent behavior to available governed artifacts.
- Graph coverage panels for languages, runtime units, providers, source scopes,
  semantic binding coverage, conflicts, unknowns, and diagnostics.
- Rich graph detail for entity attributes, relation derivation/trust/confidence,
  proof pointer, column, observation time, and provider metadata.
- Privacy-bounded graph artifact navigation and focused regression coverage for
  portable proof paths.

### Changed

- Removed the analytics consent notification and public opt-in settings;
  retention analytics are hard-disabled, including for legacy stored opt-ins,
  while local Dashboard and Incident Studio operational evidence remains.
- Added a terminal action directly beside every primary-sidebar workspace name;
  it opens an integrated terminal with that workspace as its working directory.
- Made Studio distinguish rolled-back repairs from genuine decision gates,
  preserve the CLI transaction receipt through the agent recovery loop, and
  present valid repair decisions inline against the exact transaction.
- Reworked Incident Studio into a conversation-first repair surface with a
  compact workspace header, inline CLI activity, collapsed history, and less
  duplicated dashboard chrome around the composer.
- Aligned mirrored contracts, command inventory, compatibility metadata, and
  enterprise validation with Workspai CLI 0.56.0.
- Balanced bounded graph projections across projects and architecture entity
  kinds instead of allowing one large language/runtime bucket to dominate.
- Reconciled persisted and streamed graph metadata so live rendering retains
  canonical workspace and source-scope context.
- Made Studio handoff and repair prompts consume stable canonical finding,
  causal, capability, scope, and verification identifiers.
- Made module lifecycle actions use the CLI project-scoped capability lane.
- Expanded graph Canvas and WebGL presentations for the broader polyglot entity
  and relation vocabulary.

### Fixed

- Removed the legacy inline-command branch from `RUN_ONCE` blocker recovery so
  missing-evidence producers remain inside the CLI Repair Engine transaction.
- Made governed Agent command output capture reliable for direct Node.js tools
  without enabling a shell, with bounded temporary output, timeout enforcement,
  secret-stripped environments, and guaranteed cleanup.
- Hardened the release open-issues gate against transient GitHub transport and
  retryable API failures with bounded retries, per-attempt timeouts, actionable
  transport diagnostics, explicit read permissions, and fail-closed behavior.
- Made verified repair receipts override stale `Awaiting verify` phase chrome,
  made completed intelligence rails close at `11/11`, and stopped restored
  rollback checkpoints from appearing as live file changes.
- Prevented internal source-repair policy loops or malformed persisted review
  state from creating a `Decision required` action without a CLI transaction
  and explicit decision options.
- Prevented absolute local filesystem paths and traversal-based proof paths
  from crossing the Extension Host/Webview trust boundary.
- Prevented advisory, non-applicable, unknown, or project-scoped Doctor findings
  from being promoted into incorrect workspace blockers.
- Prevented Assistant and Studio artifact inventories from drifting when the
  live report index is absent, stale, or malformed.
- Prevented architecture-significant entities from disappearing behind the
  fixed graph projection budget in large polyglot workspaces.
- Prevented supported project module commands from being blocked because they
  were not advertised as top-level CLI commands.

### Compatibility

- VS Code 1.106.0+
- Workspai CLI 0.56.0+
- RapidKit Core 0.6.0 only for Python-backed kits and modules

### Verification

- Host/Webview type checking and formatting passed; lint completed with zero
  errors and 46 pre-existing warnings.
- 377 test files passed; 2,723 tests passed and 4 were explicitly skipped.
- Exact CLI contract parity, all 172 palette commands, all 22 enterprise
  scenarios, and 162 release Stop Gate tests passed.
- Production build and VSIX inspection passed for a 164-file, 6.0 MB
  `rapidkit-vscode-0.39.0.vsix` package.
- Dependency audit reported zero vulnerabilities across 845 dependencies.

See [`releases/RELEASE_NOTES_v0.39.0.md`](releases/RELEASE_NOTES_v0.39.0.md).

## [0.38.0] - 2026-08-08

### Added

- Canonical Dashboard evidence posture with separate producer status and
  user-facing `healthy`, `attention`, and `blocked` states.
- Explicit posture icons and compact status copy shared across Dashboard
  cards, workflows, governance, repair, and artifact surfaces.
- Typed CLI repair-decision handling for missing executables, unsupported
  adapters, failed preconditions, guarded policy choices, and source repair.
- Selected-workspace file watchers for report and foundation artifacts outside
  the editor's currently open folders.
- Complete example-catalog projection for runnable workspaces and published
  profile foundations across FastAPI, NestJS, Go, Spring Boot, and .NET.
- Exact transaction diff actions beside bounded inline previews in Studio.

### Changed

- Aligned all mirrored contracts, minimum CLI policy, release baseline, and
  active user guides with Workspai CLI 0.55.1.
- Made Workspace Explain consume canonical release verdict, evidence freshness,
  and blocking state rather than inferring a blocker from high risk alone.
- Made Studio classify non-closed CLI transactions from structured decision
  causes rather than English blocker text.
- Consolidated repeated policy-rejected actions and hid rejected commands from
  the executed-command presentation.
- Kept Recent Workspaces on Home and reduced the Library to the complete
  workspace-template catalog instead of duplicating the module browser.
- Simplified Dashboard navigation, artifact presentation, action density, and
  Studio change review around one current workspace and one current outcome.

### Fixed

- Fixed `needs-attention` Workspace Explain evidence with zero blocking reasons
  appearing as a red release-blocking card.
- Fixed managed workspaces outside the open VS Code folder failing to refresh
  Dashboard cards when canonical evidence changed.
- Fixed profile workspaces and non-FastAPI/NestJS examples being omitted from
  the Library even when published by the examples repository.
- Fixed repeated forbidden evidence-producer calls flooding Studio until the
  model decision circuit breaker stopped the session.
- Fixed changed paths and inline previews competing with each other instead of
  presenting one coherent file-review surface.

### Compatibility

- VS Code 1.106.0+
- Workspai CLI 0.55.1+
- RapidKit Core 0.6.0 only for Python-backed kits and modules

### Verification

- 372 test files passed; 2,705 tests passed and 4 were explicitly skipped.
- Host/Webview type checking, formatting, linting, exact CLI contract parity,
  172-command palette parity, and all 22 enterprise scenarios passed.
- Production build, zero-high/critical dependency audit, VSIX packaging, and
  artifact smoke passed.

See [`releases/RELEASE_NOTES_v0.38.0.md`](releases/RELEASE_NOTES_v0.38.0.md).

## [0.37.0] - 2026-08-07

### Added

- CLI-owned Repair Engine integration with durable plan, precondition,
  approval, checkpoint, execution, reconciliation, verification, rollback, and
  decision-required states.
- Synchronized card-repair, repair-capabilities, proposal, transaction,
  runtime-command, and artifact contracts from Workspai CLI 0.55.0.
- Target-aware CLI transaction receipts that distinguish the selected repair
  result from unrelated blockers elsewhere in the workspace.
- Typed dependency-materialization recovery for declared projects whose local
  installed dependency tree is absent or incomplete.
- Exact repair-capability and Stop Gate coverage for every Dashboard evidence
  card.
- Live command, changed-file, and bounded unified-diff review inside Studio
  sessions, including safe review of untracked text files.
- Durable native tool-call correlation across model requests, execution events,
  observations, reloads, and resumed sessions.
- Contract and scenario coverage for sidebar density, optional Core behavior,
  public product links, card repair, dependency transactions, and live change
  review.

### Changed

- Made Workspai CLI the sole owner of mutation, reconciliation, canonical
  verification, closure, and rollback for blocker repair.
- Made Studio responsible for workspace/project scope, model interaction,
  progress, diff presentation, and explicit user decisions instead of owning a
  competing repair executor.
- Made canonical repairs preserve exact project scope and avoid guessing the
  first affected project in multi-project incidents.
- Made registered evidence names authoritative over directory basenames so
  linked projects and registry aliases reach the exact CLI repair target.
- Made bounded model history retain only coherent tool-call/result pairs so a
  restored or truncated session remains valid for OpenAI-compatible providers.
- Made Setup require only Workspai CLI; Python and RapidKit Core remain optional
  until a Python-backed capability needs them.
- Made workspace-local Core upgrades use the owning `.venv` and fail closed when
  that workspace cannot be resolved.
- Rebuilt Studio subprocess PATH from local npm and Node-version-manager
  discovery so stale Extension Host environments can still run governed CLI
  transactions.
- Reduced primary sidebar inline actions to the most frequent commands while
  retaining workspace, project, terminal, lifecycle, import, and export actions
  in grouped menus.
- Updated Getting Started and UI surface documentation for extension 0.37.0 and
  Workspai CLI 0.55.0.

### Fixed

- Fixed Studio accepting model completion before the exact card verification
  contract and canonical post-mutation chain had closed.
- Fixed a successful dependency installation being rejected merely because it
  did not require a manifest or lockfile edit.
- Fixed an unrelated workspace blocker causing a completed target repair to be
  shown as failed or repeatedly resumed.
- Fixed stale manual-only decisions trapping Resume instead of producing a
  fresh CLI-owned plan.
- Fixed repaired or restored sessions losing provider call identity and
  reviewable command/change evidence across native tool rounds.
- Fixed Dashboard creation and next-step guidance treating missing optional
  RapidKit Core as a universal blocker.
- Fixed workspace-local Core recovery falling through to an unrelated global
  `pipx` upgrade.
- Fixed stale NVM/FNM/asdf/Volta PATH state preventing Studio subprocesses from
  resolving the installed Workspai CLI and package manager.
- Fixed over-dense workspace and project rows obscuring the primary actions.
- Fixed remaining user-facing RapidKit command and workspace terminology on
  active Workspai surfaces.

### Compatibility

- VS Code 1.106.0+
- Workspai CLI 0.55.0+
- RapidKit Core 0.6.0 only for Python-backed kits and modules

### Verification

- 370 test files passed; 2,683 tests passed and 4 were explicitly skipped.
- Host/Webview type checking, formatting, linting, production build, exact
  CLI-contract parity, 22 enterprise scenarios, 2 local CLI integration
  scenarios, VSIX packaging, artifact smoke, and dependency audit passed.

See [`releases/RELEASE_NOTES_v0.37.0.md`](releases/RELEASE_NOTES_v0.37.0.md).

## [0.36.0] - 2026-08-03

### Added

- Durable Create-session recovery that turns orphaned planning/running records
  into explicit, removable stopped sessions after a Webview reload.
- First-install-safe managed workspace creation, including parent-directory
  creation, concurrent-request deduplication, marker verification, and useful
  subprocess diagnostics.
- Cross-runtime remediation-plan detail for dependency resolution paths that
  require guarded project-native investigation rather than an unsafe automatic
  fix.

### Changed

- Studio now distinguishes a persisted repair record from a live provider-owned
  process and returns control to the user when no active process owns the session.
- The Create history locks only the operation currently owned by the live
  Webview; historical interrupted sessions can be removed normally.
- CLI discovery now recognizes direct, global npm, NVM, FNM, asdf, Volta, and
  package-metadata installations without using a network-backed `npx` probe at
  activation time.
- The managed default workspace uses the CLI-aligned `minimal` profile and does
  not install the optional Python engine for unrelated project kits.

### Fixed

- Fixed fresh-install project creation failing with `unknown error` when
  `~/.workspai/workspaces` did not exist yet.
- Fixed stale Create sessions remaining permanently labelled `Creating` and
  blocking deletion after reload or an interrupted host operation.
- Fixed false CLI-missing notifications when Workspai was installed under a
  Node version manager but absent from the Extension Host's stale `PATH`.
- Fixed Studio repair recovery loops that could imply an active repair after
  the owning process had already stopped.

### Compatibility

- VS Code 1.106.0+
- Workspai CLI 0.52.3+
- RapidKit Core 0.6.0 only for Python-backed kits and modules

See [`releases/RELEASE_NOTES_v0.36.0.md`](releases/RELEASE_NOTES_v0.36.0.md).

## [0.35.0] - 2026-08-02

The implementation ledger below records the development history of this
release and may retain legacy internal command IDs or names for traceability;
it is not current usage guidance.

### Added

- **Native Studio Agent runtime**: durable Agent / Ask / Plan sessions, governed Workspai tools, causal blocker traversal, source patch transactions, dependency-security repair, and evidence-derived completion.
- **Callable model selector contract**: provider-qualified model identities with session-only transports excluded and retryable model failover for native Studio tool calls.
- **Enterprise dashboard evidence loop**: Command → Evidence → Next Step with activity trail, outcome review, next-step rail, and contract-aware command dispatch (`dashboardCommandContracts`, `dashboardCommandRegistry`).
- **Dashboard UX polish (v0.35)**: Studio Command Center handoff strip (Evidence · Run · Project · Home); Home Workspace Advisor entry and clickable health metrics; navigation telemetry dedup on re-selected tabs; responsive Run sub-nav scroll on narrow widths.
- **Enterprise-minimal stabilization pass**: Evidence Guided mode now renders one current path instead of duplicating attention cards; Evidence view controls use compact `Guided / Workflows / All` labels; Studio uses a calmer panel workspace with carded chat/context/sidebar surfaces; Workspai now contributes a standard VS Code Secondary Sidebar tab plus Activity Bar fallback, with `Create with AI / Workspace Advisor / Studio` as the minimal AI surface and a live creation timeline.
- **Evidence surfaces**: `CommandActivityPanel`, `EvidenceOutcomePanel`, `ReleaseHub`, `DashboardEvidenceSection`, governance/sparse empty states, and Incident Studio handoff from evidence cards.
- **Governance onboarding**: fresh-install onboarding, ops-chain banner, and automatic `bootstrap → doctor → analyze` chain after workspace create, clone, import, or add.
- **Operate & governance UI**: `EnterpriseDashboardFlow`, `WorkspaceGovernancePanel`, `ActionTile`, `SectionHeader`, `FrameworkIcon`, and `CommandCheatsheet`.
- **Settings bridge**: embedded `WorkspaiSettingsPanel` aligned with dashboard design tokens via `workspaiSettingsBridge`.
- **Incident Studio VNext**: primary studio surface replacing the legacy monolith, with `ChatSurface`, `ContextPanel`, `WorkspaceSidebar`, `CommandRibbon`, `CliSurfaceSection`, `ShipLoopSection`, `ActionOutcomePanel`, and `MissionControlHeader`.
- **Ship loop**: analyze → verify-gates → readiness → archive → autopilot-release with host bridges, ship evidence refresh, and stabilization loop.
- **Studio session persistence**: reload-safe state for ship loop, CLI surface, and chat brain sessions.
- **AI action framework** (host): action contract, registry, executor, safety/redaction layers, command policy, and `aiProviderService` for LLM routing.
- **Studio policy gates**: telemetry policy core, policy gate mapper parity (host + webview), guided-mode blocks for advanced CLI, and mutation gate before fix/archive/autopilot paths.
- **Studio CLI surface**: `incidentCliActionMatrix`, inline command bridge (pinned npm wrapper), doctor evidence bridge, repro pack and enterprise export bridges.
- **Studio action registry**: analyze, workspace advisor, governed fix, verify-gates, and terminal-bridge actions with audit trail.
- **Workspai design system**: token layers (`workspai-tokens`, `workspai-primitives`, studio chrome, analyze report CSS), `WorkspaiThemeProvider`, `WorkspaiEmptyState`, `WorkspaiBanner`, and contributor `DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`.
- **Design-system CI**: drift guard tests, studio chrome CSS extract/verify scripts, and website/extension parity check script.
- **AI creation intent**: `aiCreationHeuristic` and structured `languageModelResponse` parsing for safer create flows and module suggestions.
- **Analyze scoping**: `analyzeReportBridge` so dashboard and studio analyze viewers respect workspace vs project context.
- **Setup command-center**: embedded Setup & Settings with full-width host, theme-safe loading skeletons, `ToolRow` matrix, and collapsible optional/advanced sections.
- **npm governance pipeline parity** (npm `0.34.0` CLI): `workspai.workspacePipeline` (`pipeline --json --strict`), `pipeline` evidence card from `pipeline-last-run.json`, Release hub orchestrator banner, and sidebar Run & Release / Governance menu entries.
- **Vitest expansion**: dashboard bridges, studio redesign contracts, design-system drift, ship-loop integration, AI action framework, presentation contracts, and smoke stabilization suites.
- **Enterprise hardening modules**: `workspacePathBoundary`, `incidentInlineCommandRunner`, `incidentStudioStabilizationPolicy`, `dashboardEvidencePending`, and `dashboardEvidenceRefreshSchedule` (webview).
- **Workspace adoption parity**: extension adoption now delegates to canonical `rapidkit adopt --json` first, with a schema-aligned local fallback for offline or unavailable npm CLI scenarios.
- **Multi-stack adopted project discovery**: adopted frontend and backend projects can be registered outside the workspace tree and still appear in Dashboard, Evidence, Sidebar, and project discovery flows.

### Changed

- Assistant Agent mode now owns the complete card incident graph and may finish only after a fresh, non-blocking verify observation; generated reports are refreshed through canonical producers rather than edited.
- Studio turn limits are now explicit host/test boundaries only. Production Agent sessions compact into durable checkpoints and retain ownership until verified completion, cancellation, or a real provider/protocol failure.
- Native tool execution is causal-generation aware: duplicate inspections, audits, remediations, and verifies are suppressed until source or governed evidence advances; source patch results refresh the generation before the next repair step.
- Long-running Agent prompts retain causal tool and verify events while dropping duplicate request/status chatter, keeping repair sessions within provider context budgets.
- Retired legacy **`AIIncidentStudio.tsx`** (~7.5k lines) in favor of **`IncidentStudioVNext`** and modular studio regions.
- Replaced **`CommandReference`** with **`CommandCheatsheet`**; removed **`QuickLinks`**, **`HeroAction`**, and **`AIActions`** from the dashboard shell.
- Reworked **`welcomePanel`** and **`App.tsx`** for dashboard dispatch, evidence refresh, and studio integration at scale.
- Expanded workspace and project treeviews to notify governance ops chain and honor dashboard workspace payloads.
- **npm CLI verify**: Setup version probe uses developer-style `npx rapidkit --version` so terminal output matches the card; orchestration commands remain pinned.
- Guided/lite/responsive studio polish (Wave Y): denser guided conversation, action outcome essentials, collapsible sections, and responsive studio chrome.
- **Evidence refresh**: replaced multi-timer refresh storm (0 / 1.8s / 5s / 12s) with debounced coalescing (750ms + one 5s follow-up); refresh only when commands opt in via `refreshEvidence: true`.
- **Project adoption UX**: “convert generic project” is now “adopt project into Workspai workspace”; known stacks are no longer skipped and are adopted through the same governance contract.
- **Package build contract**: VSIX prepublish now builds webview assets in production mode so dev source maps do not enter the release package.

### Fixed

- Fixed dependency incidents stopping at an unsafe npm downgrade even when a compatible owner upgrade, transitive constraint, or runtime-native source transaction remained available. Studio now preserves CLI-authored resolution candidates, respects the Doctor-selected ecosystem in polyglot projects, and reaches a user decision only after bounded compatibility investigation.
- Fixed every multi-tool VS Code LM request failing before its first model turn because `LanguageModelChatToolMode.Required` was used with more than one tool.
- Fixed `copilotcli` and other session-only providers appearing as runnable Workspai models even though they cannot answer extension LM requests.
- Fixed missing/retired models and empty provider streams terminating Studio without trying another callable model.
- Fixed Readiness repairs exhausting an arbitrary 80-turn budget after repeatedly auditing the same dependency advisory; duplicate observations now remain in the model ledger but are omitted from the user-facing timeline.
- Fixed dependency repair retry state surviving a successful source patch, which could prevent the Agent from regenerating the lockfile after applying an evidence-supported manifest override.
- Fixed underspecified native patch-tool input: models now receive the exact workspace-relative full-file replacement and source-hash contract.
- Updated `adm-zip` and `axios` to patched releases and made security audit / VSIX packaging use the pinned Corepack package manager path instead of relying on a globally installed `npm` binary.
- Raised the VS Code engine floor to `1.106.0`, where contributed Secondary Sidebar containers became stable, preventing Workspai from silently falling back into Explorer or requiring a proposed API.
- Hardened Electron smoke so proposed-API rejection and missing Workspai view-container diagnostics fail the release even when the extension host exits with code zero.
- Incident Studio stable wiring gaps (doctor scope payloads, sync graph, telemetry refresh).
- AI creation intent planning and module suggestion boundaries for supported project types.
- `UserMode` typing (`standard`) and shell-view lifecycle guards for Settings/Setup tabs.
- Doctor telemetry refresh alignment with scoped workspace/project evidence.
- **Security (P0)**: user-supplied paths cannot escape the active workspace; shell metacharacters rejected; Studio inline CLI restricted to an allowlisted RapidKit surface executed without a shell.
- **Dashboard ops chain (P0)**: cross-workspace chain bleed in the webview; bootstrap step stall without timeout; silent no-op when contract dispatch fails (now warns + `dashboardCommandFailed`).
- **Evidence (P0)**: workspace-level project-doctor artifacts without project identity no longer attach to the wrong selected project; missing bootstrap card always shown.
- **Studio (P1)**: mutation gate parity via shared stabilization policy; standalone panel `incomingMessage` merge and project path/name injection.
- **Reliability (P1)**: pending evidence cards reconcile from resolved cards and activity `completed`/`failed`; removed blind 15s pending timeout.
- **Incident Studio stabilization (0.35.0)**: resync analyze-backed VNext state after report reload; project scope for standalone chat brain and palette open; CLI mutation detection without `cliActionId`; session persistence queue before load; scope selector disabled without project; ContextPanel AI/verify gate parity; chat-brain error banner; mission-control ErrorBoundary; coalesced App embed host-handler refs for CLI/ship loop.
- **Adopted project visibility**: external adopted projects written to `.rapidkit/imported-projects.json` are now resolved by workspace manager, project explorer, and welcome-panel project discovery instead of disappearing after refresh.
- **Fallback adoption drift**: if npm CLI adoption is unavailable, the extension writes aligned `project.json`, `adopt.json`, `adopt-readiness.json`, `context.json`, and workspace registry metadata instead of legacy partial markers.

### Removed

- Legacy `AIIncidentStudio` component and interaction tests (superseded by `studioRedesignContracts` and presentation contract suites).
- Dashboard **`CommandReference.tsx`**, **`QuickLinks.tsx`**, **`HeroAction.tsx`**, **`AIActions.tsx`**.

### Verification

- `./node_modules/.bin/tsc --noEmit`
- `corepack npm test` (321 files / 2282 passed / 2 skipped)
- `node scripts/release-stop-gate.mjs --skip-kpi`
- `env PATH=/tmp:$PATH ./node_modules/.bin/vsce package --no-dependencies --out /tmp/workspai-0.35.0.vsix`

## [0.33.0] - 2026-06-08

### Added

- Full `.NET` setup-runtime support across the command palette setup flow and the dashboard setup experience.
- `dotnet-only` workspace bootstrap profile across schemas, completion, hover help, AI create flows, command reference, and workspace creation UI.
- Drift guard coverage that keeps `.NET` and `dotnet-only` surfaced in setup/runtime/profile experiences.

### Changed

- Updated marketplace/package metadata to include `.NET Web API` and C# discovery terms.
- Expanded polyglot and enterprise workspace profile copy to include `.NET` alongside Python, Node.js, Go, and Java.
- Hardened release-stop-gate tests so script subprocesses run with a clean Node CLI environment instead of inheriting Vitest worker hooks.
- Reset RapidKit CLI test mocks between tests and aligned fallback expectations with the actual direct-binary-to-npx execution path.

### Fixed

- Fixed setup/runtime UI drift where `.NET` projects were supported by project creation but missing from runtime verification flows.
- Fixed dashboard setup guidance so `.NET SDK 8+` install, verify, path detection, and AI setup suggestions are visible.
- Fixed profile parity gaps where `dotnet-only` could be accepted by the CLI surface but omitted from extension schemas or UI helpers.

- Runtime command surface parity tests to keep dashboard, AI creation, module suggestions, and CLI snippets aligned with the npm wrapper.
- .NET project creation and dashboard surfaces alongside the existing FastAPI, NestJS, Go, and Spring Boot flows.

### Changed

- Updated extension-host RapidKit calls to use the pinned npm wrapper form: `npx --yes --package rapidkit rapidkit ...`.
- Aligned dashboard command reference, quick links, setup flows, project creation, and module browser copy with the latest RapidKit npm command surface.
- Restricted AI module suggestions to FastAPI and NestJS, with explicit native package ecosystem guidance for Go, Spring Boot, and .NET.
- Hardened AI prompt guidance so generated recommendations use current doctor/project/module command scopes.

### Fixed

- Fixed `.NET` AI creation messaging that could incorrectly describe Spring Boot module behavior.
- Fixed user-facing module install snippets that used unpinned `rapidkit add module` commands.
- Fixed stale doctor command examples such as `rapidkit doctor --scope=workspace` in Studio surfaces.
- Fixed module details and browser command previews so they copy the same supported CLI form documented by npm.

### Verification

- `npm run typecheck`
- `npm run check:parity-snapshot`

- Workspace Contract Registry documentation surface with screenshot coverage for sidebar Contract Graph and `workspace.contract.json` inspection.
- Shared enterprise modal foundation for workspace creation, project creation, module installation, module details, and AI creation flows.
- Webview error boundary support so dashboard rendering failures can surface recoverable errors instead of blank screens.
- Updated screenshot inventory, README tour, and media documentation for Marketplace/readme preparation.

### Changed

- Reworked dashboard IA so workspace-level actions, project-level actions, and share/archive flows sit in their correct scopes.
- Refined Project Actions and Module Browser copy to show selected project/workspace context without exposing local absolute paths.
- Simplified onboarding and setup entry points around Workspai command-center language.
- Refreshed modal interaction design with denser enterprise layout, command previews, clearer targets, and consistent footer actions.
- Updated package metadata version to `0.32.0` across `package.json` and `package-lock.json`.
- Added safe npm overrides for vulnerable transitive test dependencies while keeping the VS Code test CLI on the current release line.

### Fixed

- Fixed dashboard switch/selection refresh behavior paths covered by the redesigned workspace overview flow.
- Fixed module install/details surfaces that previously showed workspace paths where project context was expected.

### Changed

- Moved analyze lifecycle from the redesign-only Incident Studio path into the stable WelcomePanel / AIIncidentStudio experience.
- Added clearer guidance for missing analyze output and prompt users to run `rapidkit analyze`.

### Fixed

- Fixed missing analyze output flow so users are guided to rerun analysis instead of seeing an empty state.

### Other

- Recommended validation: `npm run compile` and `npm run test`.

## [0.30.0] - 2026-05-27

## [0.29.0] - 2026-05-19

### Added

- **Welcome panel chat brain tracking support** via new panel helper module:
  - `src/ui/panels/welcomePanelChatBrainTracking.ts`

### Changed

- **AI stream/runtime stabilization finalized** across host and panel paths:
  - deterministic model alias matching and safer model fallback behavior
  - request timeout and cancellation lifecycle hardening in stream execution
  - stream done signaling tightened to avoid duplicate terminal events
  - module suggestion parsing and AI response handling made more defensive
- **Command path typing hardening (enterprise consistency)**:
  - legacy command handlers migrated from unsafe `any` usage to guarded typed/unknown flows
  - workspace/project selection command contracts aligned with provider models
  - project creation command imports normalized to static imports and strict error narrowing
- **Doctor and provenance command reliability** improved through strict typing and safer contract parsing.

### Fixed

- **Type contract regressions blocking compile** in workspace/project selection integration (`workspaceSelection` <-> `extension` wiring).
- **Add module command type-safety bug** in slug resolution and selected-project payload narrowing.
- **AI service test parity** updated to match cancellation semantics and prevent stale done-event assumptions.

### Verification

- Full validation run for this release window passed:
  - `npm run compile`
  - `npm run test` (all test files passing)

## [0.28.0] - 2026-05-13

### Added

- **Enterprise E1/E2 execution slice** shipped across Incident Studio contracts:
  - **E1 baseline hardening** with versioned cross-service impact score contract (`v1`) and execution-complete confidence/scope safeguards.
  - **E2.1** local-processing memory policy profile exposure (`policyProfile`, `sensitivity`, `localProcessingMode`) in host and payload contracts.
  - **E2.2** memory write-access contract enforcement for workspace memory write paths.
  - **E2.3** repro-pack sensitivity labels end-to-end (host evidence, payload normalization, UI rendering, and export bundle contract).
  - **E2.4** memory influence audit timeline linked to decision artifacts across host -> payload -> UI -> export flow.
  - **E2.5** security review hardening coverage for memory/export paths (contract/drift/test enforcement).
- **Release governance tooling**:
  - `scripts/export-open-issues-report.mjs` added for release issue-severity evidence export.
  - release-stop gate integration and workflow usage for open-issue severity blocking.

### Changed

- **CI release gate enforcement** strengthened:
  - `.github/workflows/extension-smoke-matrix.yml` now enforces release-stop checks with open-issue severity inputs.
  - `scripts/release-stop-gate.mjs` and package scripts aligned to stricter stop-gate behavior.
- **Incident Studio host/webview contracts** updated for memory-policy governance, repro-pack security labels, and artifact-linked audit timeline evidence.
- **Impact and architecture reasoning safety** strengthened through updated system graph and lens contracts, with expanded scenario and fixture coverage.

### Fixed

- **Fail-closed mutation safety regressions prevented** with expanded drift guard and flow-level assertions for unknown-scope and policy-bound routes.
- **Memory/export redaction consistency** tightened so sensitive fields remain sanitized in normalized payloads and link-safe bundle exports.

### Verification

- Core enterprise stabilization suites for E1/E2 slices pass in the release range:
  - `src/test/impactScoreScenarioMatrix.test.ts`
  - `src/test/systemGraphIndexer.test.ts`
  - `src/test/workspaceMemoryService.test.ts`
  - `src/test/incidentReproPackUtils.test.ts`
  - `src/test/incidentStudioPayload.test.ts`
  - `src/test/AIIncidentStudio.interaction.test.ts`
  - `src/test/driftGuard.test.ts`
- Commit scope included in this release is the full range from tag `v0.27.3` to current `HEAD`.

## [0.27.3] - 2026-05-12

### Added

- **Incident Studio policy modules** — added new policy/evidence helper modules under `src/ui/panels/`:
  - `incidentStudioPolicyGates.ts`
  - `incidentStudioResponseValidator.ts`
  - `incidentStudioVerifyRerun.ts`
  - `incidentStudioVerifyDiff.ts`
  - `incidentStudioEvidenceMapping.ts`
  - `incidentStudioEvidenceProvenance.ts`
  - `incidentStudioConfidenceUI.ts`
  - `incidentStudioExportProvenance.ts`
- **Core backend contract modules**:
  - `src/core/backendFrameworkContract.ts` (framework/runtime -> stack contract)
  - `src/core/verifyPackContractExporter.ts` (export verify-pack contract to `.rapidkit/reports`)
  - `src/core/workspaceHygieneProbes.ts` (duplicate-deps, SCM hygiene, README framework alignment)
- **Parity snapshot automation** — added deterministic shared snapshot sync/check commands:
  - `sync:parity-snapshot`
  - `check:parity-snapshot`
  - `contracts/backend-import-stack-parity.snapshot.json`
  - `scripts/sync-import-stack-parity-snapshot.mjs`
- **Release notes artifact** — added `releases/RELEASE_NOTES_v0.27.3.md`.
- **Regression suites** — added focused test coverage for policy gates, verifier rerun/diff, evidence provenance/export, response contract validation, workspace boundary matching, and parity snapshot checks.

### Changed

- **Incident Studio claim coherence (webview)** — `webview-ui/src/components/AIIncidentStudio.tsx` now enforces NO-GO/verify-gate truth in UI claims:
  - blocks success messaging when verify/release gates are unsatisfied
  - downgrades GO to gated HOLD when verify completion gates are not met
  - surfaces explicit scope-truth and flow-vs-telemetry labels
  - guided mode now renders deterministic next+verify intent chips and hides dense action board panel
- **Command transport + display separation**:
  - execution path normalized to portable `npx --yes --package rapidkit rapidkit ...`
  - user-facing command rendering simplified to `rapidkit ...`
  - applied across Incident Studio, command reference, and welcome panel pathways
- **Workspace stabilization telemetry model** (`src/utils/workspaceUsageTracker.ts`):
  - added thresholds/metrics/gates for:
    - `routeFallbackNonSuccessShare`
    - `verifyIncompleteWarningRate`
    - `topVerifyPathMissReasonShare`
  - propagated to payload contract types and Incident Studio KPI cards/exports
- **Welcome panel runtime hardening** (`src/ui/panels/welcomePanel.ts`):
  - explicit shell dispatch per OS for terminal-bridge execution
  - incident telemetry refresh wrapped with safe fallback postMessage
  - command scope detection expanded for workspace-level rapidkit actions
- **Release gate enforcement in CI** — removed KPI bypass from smoke matrix release gate and switched to fixture-backed inputs (`wave3-kpi-marker`, claim checklist, enterprise gate, release posture label).
- **Formatting gate in CI** — added `format:check` to smoke workflow (non-Windows) for local/CI parity.

### Fixed

- **Workspace path prefix-collision bug** — `src/utils/findWorkspace.ts` now uses normalized boundary-safe containment checks, so sibling paths like `workspace-other` are no longer treated as nested under `workspace`.
- **Doctor command messaging parity** — doctor evidence tooltips/context hints now use the portable canonical invocation.
- **Formatting consistency in release branch** — normalized prettier formatting on high-churn files used by validation.

## [0.27.2] - 2026-05-10

### Fixed

- **Webview disposal safety** — prevented `Webview is disposed` uncaught errors in the Setup panel:
  - All `postMessage` calls are now guarded by a `_safePostMessage()` helper that checks disposal state before sending
  - Added `_isDisposing` flag set immediately on `onDidDispose` to stop any in-flight async callbacks
  - Registered message listener via `this._disposables` for proper cleanup lifecycle
  - Eliminated three uncaught errors (`Webview is disposed`) visible in the extension host output when closing the Setup panel

## [0.27.1] - 2026-05-10

### Added

- **Workspace Run command suite** — added first-class workspace stage commands and picker flow:
  - `workspai.workspaceRunStage`
  - `workspai.workspaceRunInit`
  - `workspai.workspaceRunTest`
  - `workspai.workspaceRunBuild`
  - `workspai.workspaceRunStart`

- **AI Workspace Command Center** — added `workspai.aiWorkspaceCommandCenter` with a categorized operation launcher for workspace navigation, health, and governance commands.

- **Project-scoped Doctor command** — added `workspai.projectDoctor` with explicit Check/Fix selection and project-aware routing from Incident Studio.

- **Doctor treatment telemetry envelope** — Incident Studio telemetry now includes `doctorTreatmentStatus` (trend, drift deltas, scope provenance, traceability coverage, probe failures/warnings) and corresponding UI rendering.

### Changed

- **Workspace init execution path** — `workspai.workspaceInit` now runs canonical `workspace run init` flow for consistent fleet-stage semantics.

- **Workspace operations targeting** — normalized workspace target resolution from command payloads and selection context across workspace operations and selection commands.

- **Incident Studio command wiring** — doctor actions route to workspace/project-aware commands, adds project doctor report access, and improves scope-aware labels in telemetry UI.

- **AI command catalog** — expanded AI action surface with workspace governance and command-center integration; command documentation aligned to `npx rapidkit ...` syntax.

### Fixed

- **Sensitive path exposure in doctor/compliance surfaces** — outputs now use link-safe/sanitized path hints instead of leaking full absolute report directories.

- **Command docs and hints parity** — corrected stale command hints such as `npx workspai.doctor workspace` to canonical `npx rapidkit doctor workspace`.

- **Drift guard/test alignment** — updated drift assertions and Incident Studio telemetry tests to match current command contracts and doctor treatment payload shape.

## [0.27.0] - 2026-05-08

### Added

- **Incident routing shared module** — extracted all action-type routing logic into `incidentRouting.ts` (`routeIncidentActionTypeFromMessage`). Eliminates drift between panel implementation and tests; tests now import the real function directly rather than asserting on source text. `RoutingResult` type is exported and shared across routing consumers.

- **Specialist intent routing** — four new deterministic routing branches in the incident router:
  - **DevOps/CI-CD** (`ci/cd`, `pipeline`, `kubernetes`, `helm`, `dockerfile`, `docker compose`) → `doctor-fix`
  - **Database/schema** (`schema`, `migration`, `sql`, `postgres`, `mysql`, `mongodb`) → `change-impact-lite`
  - **Docs/runbook/ADR** (`documentation`, `readme`, `runbook`, `adr`) → `workspace-memory-wizard`
  - **Architecture/risk** (`architecture`, `risk`, `blast radius`, `refactor plan`) → `change-impact-lite`

- **Scope-aware suggested questions** — `_buildSuggestedQuestions` accepts `scopeIntent: 'workspace' | 'project'` and returns deterministic, non-generic questions per specialist intent and standard action type. Workspace scope surfaces topology/governance questions; project scope surfaces per-service execution questions.

- **Phase-gate UI alignment** — `phaseContext` in `AIIncidentStudio.tsx` aligned with backend telemetry gates:
  - `diagnosisReady`: `telemetryHardGatePass` as corroborating signal
  - `planReady`: blocked when `telemetryRoutePrecisionPass` is false and telemetry data exists
  - `verifyReady`: requires `qualityScore >= 60` for verify-pack path; `telemetryVerifyPathPass` as alternative pass signal
  - `priorResolutionAvailable`: extended with `verifiedOutcomeLoopStatus.verifiedOutcomes > 0`

- **Data-driven Action Matrix** — `incidentCliActionMatrix.ts` refactored to a canonical source: stable matrix-prefixed IDs, explicit workspace/project scope per entry, `actionTypes` array for routing resolution, and two resolver functions (`resolveIncidentCliActionByActionType`, `resolveIncidentCliActionIdByActionType`) for end-to-end routing alignment.

- **Module Graph Tree in Incident Studio** — doctor evidence payload enriched with `installedModules` from registry manifests; `AIIncidentStudio.tsx` renders framework-grouped module graph with interactive filters (framework dropdown, severity: healthy/warning/critical, module search) and a stability guard that auto-resets the framework filter when the selected framework is no longer present in the dataset.

- **BYOP stack expansion** — `detectProjectStack` extended with BYOP-first detection for six additional stacks: `django`, `flask`, `express`, `koa`, `rails`, `dotnet`. Discovery uses framework-specific file markers (`manage.py`, `wsgi.py`, `app.py`, `app.js`/`server.js`, `Gemfile`/`config/routes.rb`, `*.csproj`/`*.sln`).

- **Enterprise gate fixtures** — `releases/fixtures/wave2-enterprise-gate.json` and `wave3-enterprise-gate.json` provide deterministic gate snapshots with `consecutiveWindowsPass: 2` for regression protection. `releases/fixtures/release-posture-label.md` labels current posture as `stabilization-only`.

- **Incident conversation metrics** — new `incidentConversationMetrics.ts` module: `buildIncidentLifecycleMetrics(input, nowMs)` sanitizes malformed numbers/timestamps before telemetry emission, preventing NaN or negative values from corrupting KPI windows.

- **Incident resume snapshot hardening** — `incidentStudioResume.ts` adds `toNonNegativeInteger`, `toNonNegativeTimestamp`, and `toValidTurns` sanitizers to `buildIncidentResumeSnapshot`; malformed turn counts and timestamps are clamped to safe values.

### Changed

- **Doctor telemetry refresh** — `doctorTelemetryRefresh.ts` adds `onError` hook and async catch in the refresh executor, preventing unhandled promise rejections from crashing the extension host on telemetry refresh failures.

- **Release gate workflows** — `release-gate-wave2.yml` and `release-gate-wave3.yml` hardened: severity parser extracted to shared helper, paginated GitHub issue fetch replaces single-page query, fixture fallback paths removed (hard-fail when KPI marker is missing).

- **Test regression coverage** — three `incidentStudioPromptPolicy.test.ts` route-precision tests updated to read from `incidentRouting.ts` (the real implementation) rather than `welcomePanel.ts`. Test suite: **731/731 tests passing** (66 files).

### Fixed

- **Prompt policy route-precision test source paths** — `route precision: doctor-fix and recipe-pack`, `terminal-bridge requires explicit terminal signal`, and `fix-preview-lite requires patch context` tests were asserting on `welcomePanel.ts` source after routing logic was extracted to `incidentRouting.ts`. Tests now correctly reference the live routing module.

## [0.26.0] - 2026-05-08

### Added

- **Browser smoke test action** — new `browser-smoke-test` action type in Incident Studio, aligned with VS Code 1.119 browser agent tools. The action enables AI-guided smoke testing of web applications by opening the project's running dev server in VS Code's simple browser and asking the AI to verify key UI surfaces, endpoints, and HTTP status codes. Fully integrated across all four contract layers: action matrix, prompt policy, payload contracts, and routing logic.

- **Smart rate-limit fallback** — implements one-shot intelligent fallback on retryable model errors (429, rate limit, quota, service unavailable, overloaded). Fallback only triggers before first chunk is streamed (prevents duplicate partial responses), includes automatic model selection cache reset via `resetModelSelectionCache()`, and falls back to raw model registry if auto-selection picks the same model again. Adds `emittedFromPrimary` guard and returns updated `modelId` on successful fallback.

- **Regression test for fallback** — new test in `aiService.test.ts`: `"falls back to another model when initial request fails with retryable rate-limit error"`. Validates that when autoModel throws 429, fallbackModel is called and streamed response is returned with correct fallback modelId.

### Changed

- **Model selection normalization semantics** — fixes v0.25.0 regression where literal string `'auto'` was being converted to null/undefined. All three normalize helpers (`normalizeSelectedModelId` in App.tsx, `normalizeRequestedModelId` in welcomePanel.ts, `normalizePreferredModelId` in aiService.ts) now preserve `'auto'` as a real model value and only convert truly empty strings/whitespace to null/undefined. This ensures the Auto model selection UI state doesn't collapse when users explicitly request Auto model.

- **Incident Studio View controls styling** — improved readability of Maximize and Lite/Full view toggle buttons by increasing font-size to 10.2px for labels, 12px for icon symbols, adding letter-spacing 0.01em, and setting font-weight 800 for bold emphasis. Used dedicated `.incident-header-group--view` CSS context selector to isolate sizing to View toggles only, preventing impact on other header chips.

### Fixed

- **driftGuard test assertion** — updated `keeps AI modal stop-generation contract aligned across webview and panel` test to split the assertion for `context: ctx, requestId` into two separate checks (`context: ctx,` and `requestId,`) matching the actual multi-line object formatting in `App.tsx`. This was a pre-existing formatting drift from earlier refactoring with no functional impact to the modal stop-generation contract itself.

## [0.25.0] - 2026-05-07

### Added

- **S01 fallback-reason breakdown** — `fallbackReasonBreakdown` now classified into 5 categories (`success`, `bare_keyword_only`, `fix_preview_fallback`, `orchestrate_default`, `other`) for every `next_action_clicked` event; visible in Stabilization KPI snapshot and card UI. Prevents false-positive route-precision claims by exposing fallback mix distribution.
- **S02 verify-path miss reasons (top offenders)** — `verifyPathReasonTop` tracks top-5 miss reasons by frequency; included in snapshot Markdown export and Stabilization KPI card. Drives weekly remediation backlog for verify-path gaps.
- **S04 recovery class breakdown** — `recoveryClassBreakdown` segments rollback events into `auto_rollback`, `manual_recovery`, `unspecified`; included in snapshot export and card stats row. Prevents aggregate recovery rate hiding manual-burden shifts.
- **S05 cohort validation** — `repeatVerifiedWithArtifactReady` and `repeatVerifiedWithArtifactRate` track repeated incidents that have both `repeatedIncident=true` and `replayReady=true` on the `verified_outcome_ready_for_artifact` event. New S05-Cohort metric card added to Stabilization KPI gate UI.
- **False-positive risk mitigation docs** — KPI map, weekly dashboard template, 6-week plan, and canonical story updated with S01–S05 operational playbooks, thresholds, remediation owners, and weekly runbook.

### Changed

- **Stabilization KPI snapshot** — Markdown export now includes S01 fallback mix, S02 top miss reasons, S04 recovery class mix, and S05 cohort stats in addition to S01–S05 gate table.
- **`StudioStabilizationKpiStatus` metrics contract** — extended with `fallbackReasonBreakdown`, `verifyPathReasonTop`, `recoveryClassBreakdown`, `repeatVerifiedWithArtifactReady`, and `repeatVerifiedWithArtifactRate` fields (all optional, backward-compatible).
- **KPI Dictionary status** — S05 promoted from `Partial` to `Available` (cohort validation via artifact/replay ID linking now instrumented).

## [0.24.1] - 2026-05-06

### Added

- **AI-first dashboard spotlighting** - added compact AI Features cards, a featured Incident Studio entry point, a Quick Links "build with AI" cue, and editor quick-fixes README coverage with screenshot 8.
- **Project kit recovery affordance** - added an on-demand kit retry path when the project modal opens before available kits have loaded.

### Changed

- **Incident Studio control-surface polish** - reworked header controls, mode/view layout, maximize behavior, active-scope presentation, and removed the redundant project/workspace context bar.
- **Navigation and setup affordances** - updated dashboard/Incident Studio tabs, setup entry points, and scope syncing between host and webview so users land in the right surface with the right context.
- **README and product messaging refresh** - streamlined README copy, aligned screenshots 1-8, and reinforced backend AI workflow positioning including Spring Boot support.

### Fixed

- **Project Explorer add-module routing** - fixed right-click add-module payload serialization so project actions no longer fail on circular command arguments.
- **Analyze/test visual ambiguity** - separated Analyze visuals from Run Tests with AI-themed icons and corrected tab/button alignment regressions.
- **Incident Studio state and first-open races** - fixed stale scope synchronization, first-open kit loading gaps, and the header regression introduced during layout compaction.

## [0.24.0] - 2026-05-05

### Added

- **CLC1 decision clarity contract** — added a single structured decision clarity payload for Incident Studio actionable outputs with situation, reason, scope, risk, next step, verify plan, rollback plan, and evidence links.
- **CLC5 outcome KPI model** — added `incidentOutcomeKpi` computation and marker telemetry records for first-action success, reopen, override, verify completion, rollback success, and time-to-first-confident-action.
- **Artifact criteria and mode adapters** — added `incidentArtifactCriteria` and `incidentUxModeAdapter` modules with dedicated acceptance and regression test coverage.

### Changed

- **CLC2 mutation safety enforcement** — moved decision field validation to pre-execution and block completion/mutation-ready language whenever required clarity fields are missing.
- **CLC3 deterministic phase policy wiring** — connected phase rail and next-action behavior to deterministic policy evaluation instead of heuristic progression.
- **CLC6 UX mode behavior hardening** — applied Guided/Standard/Expert policy consistently to primary and secondary CTAs, including multi-CTA paths.
- **CLC7 evidence rendering coverage** — completed UI wiring for all artifact kinds (verify, diagnosis, sandbox, rollback, repro) with explicit per-criterion status display and styles.
- **Release stop gate integration** — made outcome KPI checks part of mandatory release gate `overallPass` evaluation.

### Fixed

- **Decision clarity dead path** — fixed host-to-webview contract so decision clarity is emitted in `aiChatActionResult` and no longer remains an unused card path.
- **Mode bypass and criteria styling gaps** — fixed Expert-mode action filtering bypass and missing criteria/card status classes in Incident Studio styles.

## [0.23.0] - 2026-05-05

### Added

- 🧭 **Enterprise import and BYOP readiness surfaces** — expanded import command flow, workspace/project integration points, and extension wiring for safer multi-workspace onboarding and drift control.
- 📈 **W07/W08 validation instrumentation** — added release-readiness decision outcome tracking (`GO`/`NO-GO`) and artifact-linked validation telemetry to support decision accuracy and incident-prevention KPIs.
- 🌙 **Nightly Incident Studio soak workflow** — introduced dedicated soak automation workflow to continuously exercise Incident Studio stability paths.
- 🧪 **Contract runtime and stress regression coverage** — added `workspaiContractRuntime` module and tests plus broader release-stop/stress validation suites.

### Changed

- 🚦 **Wave 3 release-stop gate visibility** — gate output now includes release-readiness validation metrics and clearer KPI evidence blocks alongside existing hard-gate signals.
- 🧩 **Incident Studio host/webview contract parity** — synchronized payload normalization, prompt policy, telemetry typing, and panel behavior across extension and webview layers.
- ⚙️ **Core command and workspace orchestration** — refined command routing and workspace operations for stronger enterprise reliability in cross-project flows.

### Fixed

- 🛡️ **Claim and scope safety alignment** — tightened shipped-scope wording and evidence alignment to avoid over-claiming behavior outside verified release boundaries.
- 🔧 **Telemetry type and gate regression mismatches** — resolved time-window compatibility and stabilized targeted release-gate regressions for newly added KPIs.

## [0.22.0] - 2026-04-29

### Added

- 🚨 **Incident Studio foundation** — shipped the core AI Incident Studio experience with lifecycle-aware payload contracts, graph-backed action handling, protocol fixtures, support panels for memory/resume/telemetry/prompt policy, and end-to-end regression coverage.
- 🧭 **System graph + Architecture Lens baseline** — added the workspace system graph indexer, deterministic blast-radius scoring, Incident Studio Architecture Lens, editor CodeLens surface, and inline architecture warnings for supported source files.
- 🔁 **Release gate and rollback baseline** — added wave-2 stop-gate automation, release gate manifest/KPI wiring, verify-first policy enforcement, hard-gate telemetry, and verify-fail auto-rollback evidence plumbing.
- 🧰 **Setup and workspace operations upgrade** — replaced the old setup panel with the new setup experience, added workspace share bundle import/export flows in the dashboard, restored module browser responsiveness, and expanded workspace/project command coverage.
- 🩺 **Doctor and telemetry surfaces** — added doctor telemetry refresh views and richer project context/log reporting for release gating and runtime observability.
- 🧪 **Deep regression coverage** — added contract, flow, graph, telemetry, release-gate, workspace-share, and A08-specific tests across the extension and webview layers.

### Changed

- 🧠 **AI context pipeline hardening** — introduced a formal AI context contract and resolver, expanded project-context extraction, refreshed system prompt/prompt message shaping, and aligned AI/debug/chat flows on the same context-rich path.
- 🖥️ **UI and webview modernization** — refreshed large parts of the dashboard, Actions, setup, project creation, and incident surfaces to support the new Workspai workflows and responsive layouts.
- 🧩 **Command/provider/schema alignment** — updated command handlers, config-file completion/hover support, schemas, tree views, wizards, and extension activation wiring so the new surfaces work coherently in-editor and in-webview.
- 📦 **Dependency security refresh** — lockfile dependencies were refreshed through `npm audit fix`, clearing current production dependency findings for the release line.

### Fixed

- 🔒 **Prompt and mutation safety** — tightened prompt sanitization, adversarial-input guards, verify-readiness enforcement, and unknown-scope blocking so risky actions degrade safely.
- 🔄 **Workspace flow stability** — fixed workspace detection, project switching, sync cache invalidation, partial-failure normalization, webview readiness races, and module browser responsiveness.
- 🧩 **Architecture evidence fragmentation** — impact, predictive, and release-gate signals are now presented as one coherent architecture review surface instead of several loosely related cards.
- 🛡️ **Production dependency audit findings** — runtime npm audit findings are resolved for the current shipped dependency tree; only upstream dev-tooling issues without an available fix remain.

## [0.21.0] - 2026-04-23

### Added

- ✦ **AI action surface expansion** — added AI flow commands to the extension command palette and menus: `workspai.aiQuickActions`, `workspai.aiOrchestrate`, `workspai.aiFixPreviewLite`, `workspai.aiChangeImpactLite`, `workspai.aiTerminalBridge`, `workspai.aiWorkspaceMemoryWizard`, and `workspai.aiRecipePacks`.
- 📊 **Telemetry commands + onboarding experiment analytics** — new commands `workspai.showTelemetrySummary`, `workspai.resetTelemetry`, `workspai.showAIFeatureOnboarding`, and `workspai.showOnboardingExperimentStats` with workspace-scoped summaries and experiment CTR analysis.
- 🧭 **AI onboarding tour** — in-product AI onboarding messages with follow-up toast variants and command telemetry events for onboarding flows.

### Changed

- 🧱 **Sidebar and webview quick-action alignment** — WORKSPACES / PROJECTS inline action ordering now matches the expanded AI flow model; Actions webview now exposes AI Flows, telemetry, and onboarding shortcuts.
- 🧠 **Telemetry instrumentation coverage** — both `@workspai` chat participant and AI modal now emit structured success/error/cancel outcome telemetry with context-safe guards.
- 🎛️ **Project context insights panel** — new workspace telemetry and onboarding experiment summary views in `projectContextAndLogs` with copyable quick summaries.

### Fixed

- 🩺 **Doctor network safety** — version metadata fetch now enforces timeout, redirect bounds, and same-host redirect checks to reduce hangs and unsafe redirect behavior.
- 🚀 **Dev server port probing resilience** — project start flow now uses bounded port scan attempts with warning fallback instead of unbounded recursive probing.
- 📁 **Workspace registry initialization race** — config directory creation is now synchronous at startup to avoid first-run path timing issues.

## [0.20.0] - 2026-04-20

### Added

- 🤖 **`@workspai` Chat Participant** — register `@workspai` in the VS Code Chat panel with two slash commands: `/ask` (full-context Q&A scoped to the active project) and `/debug` (structured debug flow: root cause + fix + prevention). Reuses the same `prepareAIConversation → streamAIResponse` pipeline as the Workspai modal for identical AI quality.
- ✦ **AI Create presets** — the AI Create modal now ships with categorised quick-fill prompt options (SaaS & commerce, core backend, microservices, data & ML, internal tools). Smart scoring surfaces the most relevant presets based on partial user input.
- 📊 **"Which backend next?" poll** — in-sidebar quick poll lets users vote for the next supported framework (Django / Express / Spring); result is acknowledged inline.
- 🔧 **Workspace bootstrap, setup, init, policy, cache, mirror commands** — new `workspai.workspaceBootstrap`, `workspai.workspaceSetup`, `workspai.workspaceInit`, `workspai.workspacePolicyShow/Set`, `workspai.cacheStatus/Clear/Prune/Repair`, `workspai.mirrorStatus/Sync/Verify/Rotate`, and `workspai.checkForUpdates` commands registered and palette-accessible.
- 🧪 **WorkspaceMemoryService unit tests** — new `src/test/workspaceMemoryService.test.ts` covering read/write, sanitisation, timestamp validation, and concurrent-access paths.

### Changed

- 🧠 **Workspace memory hardening** — `WorkspaceMemoryService` now validates and sanitises all `context`, `conventions`, `decisions`, and `lastUpdated` fields on every read, auto-corrects corrupt entries, and writes back only the cleaned structure.
- ⚡ **Live module list in AI context** — `aiService` now fetches the available module catalogue directly from the CLI (`rapidkit modules list --json-schema 1`) with a 60-second in-process TTL cache, so AI responses reference the real current module set rather than a static snapshot.
- 🔁 **Idempotent workspace creation** — `createWorkspace` now detects partial directories (directory exists, no `.rapidkit-workspace` marker) and offers a "Replace (delete & recreate)" prompt; if the workspace marker already exists the CLI call is skipped entirely for a silent success.
- 🎨 **Brand icons updated** — `workspai.png` and `workspai.svg` updated to current Workspai identity; stale `rapidkits.svg` removed.

### Fixed

- 🛡️ **AI module slug validation** — module slugs returned by AI are validated against the live module list and the `vendor/category/slug` regex before being applied, preventing hallucinated module names from reaching the CLI.
- 📐 **AI project context enrichment** — context payload now includes `python_version`, `rapidkit_cli_version`, `rapidkit_core_version`, `installed_modules`, `workspace_health`, `runtime`, and `engine` fields so the model has complete environment awareness.

### Changed

- 🧭 **Workspai positioning sync** across the extension README, Marketplace description, and webview header so public-facing messaging consistently uses the canonical product line: "The AI workspace for backend teams"
- 🐹 **Go AI guidance** in `aiService` now explains the current Go support boundary more clearly: supported kits are `gofiber.standard` and `gogin.standard`, and Go projects should be extended with native Go packages and internal adapters rather than RapidKit marketplace modules
- 🏷️ **Go kit metadata cleanup** — removed misleading `modular` tags from Go/Fiber and Go/Gin kit descriptors

### Fixed

- 🧠 **Workspace memory action icon restored** — `rapidkit.editWorkspaceMemory` now uses a valid codicon so the inline edit-memory action renders visibly in the WORKSPACES sidebar instead of leaving only an empty clickable area
- 🪟 **Platform-safe npm wrapper execution** — `buildRapidkitCommand()` now forces package resolution through `npx --yes --package rapidkit rapidkit ...`, preventing local launcher shadowing from the current working directory
- 🐹 **Go framework detection** — `workspaceDetector` now detects `gofiber.standard` and `gogin.standard` from real `go.mod` dependencies instead of RapidKit-specific package strings, with regression tests added for both frameworks
- 🩺 **`rapidkit-core` verification reliability** — setup panel checks now use `pip show` / `pipx list` based verification paths that are more stable across Windows and Linux environments
- 🎼 **Poetry verification robustness** — setup panel now probes real Poetry executable candidates only when they actually exist, reducing noisy or misleading verification failures

## [0.19.0] - 2026-04-18

### Added

- 🤖 **AI model selector** in the AI modal header — users can choose any Copilot-registered language model (Claude, GPT, Gemini, etc.) from a compact inline dropdown before sending a query. Premium users see their full model list; free-tier users see what's available to them.
- 🧠 **Thinking indicator** while the AI context-scan phase runs — animated bouncing dots replace the blank waiting state so users have clear feedback before the first token arrives.
- 📝 **MarkdownRenderer component** (`webview-ui/src/components/MarkdownRenderer.tsx`) — lightweight zero-dependency markdown renderer for AI responses supporting headings, bold/italic, inline code, fenced code blocks, ordered/unordered lists, and HR rules.

### Changed

- ⚡ **Real-time AI streaming** — fixed the "all at once" delivery problem. Extension host now flushes chunk batches every 50 ms via `setInterval`, breaking VS Code IPC batching that was holding tokens until stream completion.
- 🎨 **Streaming render path** — `MarkdownRenderer` no longer runs `parseBlocks` on every animation frame during streaming. Raw text is displayed instantly during the stream; a single parse pass runs after completion for formatted output.
- 🗂️ **Quick-prompt chips** hidden while streaming/thinking to reduce visual noise.
- 🔧 **`collapseAll` tree view** switched to native `showCollapseAll: true` on the `rapidkitProjects` view contribution — removes the invalid `workbench.actions.treeView.rapidkitProjects.collapseAll` menu entry warning.

### Fixed

- 🐛 **Menu item warning** — `workbench.actions.treeView.rapidkitProjects.collapseAll` was referenced in `menus` but not registered in `commands`; resolved by using VS Code's built-in `showCollapseAll` view property.

## [0.18.0] - 2026-04-17

### Added

- 🧠 **Deep AI project context** in `aiService` for FastAPI/NestJS/Go workspaces with richer framework and file-signal extraction before generation and debugging.
- ✅ **New AI regression coverage** with dedicated tests for alias/model handling and AI debugger command flow.

### Changed

- 🤖 **Model selection hardening** for GitHub Models/Copilot chat models, including robust alias resolution and safer fallback ordering.
- 🧵 **Workspace memory I/O migrated to async flow** to avoid blocking extension interactions.
- 🎛️ **AI interaction consistency** by routing legacy debug/brain entry points through the shared Workspai AI modal pipeline.

### Fixed

- 🛡️ **Prompt budget safeguards** to prevent oversized AI prompts and reduce timeout/failure risk on large repositories.
- 🧩 **Module slug typo auto-correction** with conservative matching to reduce failed module operations from minor naming mistakes.
- 🔁 **Webview AI request lifecycle stability** with stronger request correlation/cancel behavior across panel and modal flows.

## [0.17.1] - 2026-04-17

### Performance

- **WORKSPACES sidebar — two-phase rendering** (`workspaceExplorer`) — `getChildren()` previously blocked on three per-workspace async ops: `versionService.getVersionInfo()` (subprocess + pip network call, 5 s timeout), `getBootstrapProfile()` (disk read), and `_countInstalledModules()` (recursive registry.json scan). Items now render instantly from cache; metadata (version badge, profile, module count) loads in background via `_scheduleBackgroundMetadataLoad` and fills in without user action.
- **PROJECTS sidebar — two-phase rendering** (`projectExplorer`) — `getChildren()` now returns items immediately from `this.projects` cache and schedules `_scheduleProjectLoad()` in background; `loadProjects()` uses `Promise.all` for parallel `pathExists` checks per project instead of a sequential if/else chain.
- **AVAILABLE MODULES — two-phase rendering** (`moduleExplorer`) — `getChildren()` immediately returns a `loading~spin` spinner item and fires `_scheduleBackgroundCatalogLoad()` instead of `await`-ing `_ensureCatalogLoaded()` (which ran a subprocess on cache miss). Catalog fills in when background load completes.
- **Extension activation** — `workspaceDetector.detectRapidKitProjects()` is no longer `await`-ed at activation; fires in background with `.catch()` — extension activates without blocking on workspace detection.
- **`coreVersionService` TTL** — version cache TTL extended from 5 min → 30 min. Python package version changes rarely; the subprocess version check runs far less often.
- **`examplesService` timeout** — axios request timeout reduced from 10 s → 5 s.

### Fixed

- **AVAILABLE MODULES empty state** — `getChildren()` now returns `[]` when no project is selected, allowing the VS Code `viewsWelcome` rich empty state to show (icon + heading + description + button) instead of a bare placeholder tree item.
- **Removed fragile `setTimeout` for doctor refresh** — two `setTimeout(5000)` / `setTimeout(8000)` calls after doctor re-run and autofix have been removed. The file watcher on `doctor-last-run.json` already handles refresh automatically.
- **`HeroAction.tsx` badge alignment** — `$(sparkle)` icon inside `.hero-badge` span now aligns inline with text (`inline-flex items-center gap-1` / `display: inline-flex`).
- **Dead code removed** — `_ensureCatalogLoaded()` in `moduleExplorer` deleted; it was no longer called after two-phase refactor.

### Changed

- `package.json` — `viewsWelcome` for `rapidkitModules` updated with icon `$(package)`, heading, description, and an "Open Projects" link button (shown when `!rapidkit:projectSelected`).
- `package.json` — `concurrently` added to `devDependencies` (was used in `dev` script but missing from declared deps).

### Added

- ✦ **AI Debug Actions (Code Actions)** — `✦ Debug with Workspai AI` and `✦ Explain error with AI` quick-fix actions appear in the editor lightbulb for Python, TypeScript, JavaScript, and Go files that have diagnostics or a text selection; opens the AI modal with the error/selection pre-filled in Debug mode
- ✦ **Doctor Fix with AI** — each issue in the **Workspace Health** sidebar panel now has a ✨ inline button; clicking it opens the AI modal with the full issue context pre-filled, ready for analysis
- ✦ **AI Module Suggestions** — the Create Project modal now has a "Suggest modules with AI" button that recommends the top modules for your chosen framework and project description
- **Minimizable AI Create modal** — a `−` minimize button appears during `thinking` and `creating` steps; the modal collapses to a floating pill in the bottom-left corner so the dashboard stays usable; auto-restores when creation completes

### Changed

- **Quick Actions sidebar** — consolidated to a single `✦ AI Assistant` button (`$(sparkle)` icon) that opens the AI modal; redundant "Workspace Brain" button removed
- **`rapidkit.debugWithAI` command** — now opens the main Workspai panel AI modal instead of a separate HTML tab; context (editor selection or diagnostics) is passed as `prefillQuestion`
- **`rapidkit.workspaceBrain` command** — now focuses the main Workspai panel instead of opening a separate HTML tab
- **Doctor Fix with AI** — removed scratch-doc workaround; issue text is now passed directly as `prefillQuestion` to the AI modal

### Fixed

- `AIModal.tsx` — added `context` to `useEffect` dependency array so that `prefillQuestion` is correctly applied even when the modal is already mounted with a previous context

### Added

- ✦ **AI actions on workspace cards** — each workspace in the Recent Workspaces list now has a `✦` button (visible on hover) that opens the AI modal pre-loaded with that workspace's context
- ✦ **AI actions on module cards** — each module card in the Module Browser now has a `✦` button that opens the AI modal with the module's context (Module Advisor)
- **`aiForWorkspace` / `aiForModule` webview messages** handled in `WelcomePanel` — routes to `showAIModal()` with correct context type

### Fixed

- **Critical: `command 'rapidkit.workspaceSelected' already exists`** — removed duplicate `registerCommand` call from `ProjectExplorer` constructor; command is now registered only once in `extension.ts`
- `projectExplorer.setWorkspace()` is now correctly called when `rapidkit.workspaceSelected` fires (previously only `doctorEvidenceExplorer.refresh()` was called)

## [0.16.0] - 2026-03-22

### Added

- 🩺 **Doctor Evidence Viewer** (`DoctorEvidenceProvider` tree view)
  - New `WORKSPACE HEALTH` panel in the RapidKit sidebar activity bar

- 📦 **Module install modal from Available Modules sidebar**
  - New command `rapidkit.showModuleInstallModal`
  - Clicking a module in the sidebar opens the `InstallModuleModal` (same as welcome page cards)
  - New webview message `openModuleInstallModal` handled in `App.tsx`
  - `WelcomePanel.showModuleInstallModal()` static method + `_pendingModuleModal` queue

### Changed

- 🧩 `WelcomePanel` gains `setExtensionContext()` static method so sidebar components can open the panel without passing context
- 🔄 Initial workspace path sync: after `workspaceExplorer.refresh()` on activation, health panel is immediately seeded with the auto-selected workspace

## [0.15.0] - 2026-02-27

  - Improved contrast and focus states for dark/light themes

- 🌐 **Example workspaces behavior**
  - External links are opened via extension host (not direct webview popups)
  - Browsing and cloning URLs are separated (`repoUrl` vs `cloneUrl`)

- 🧠 **Workspace vs project state handling in modules UI**
  - Module cards/install actions now require selected **project** (not just workspace)
  - Module install/update gating aligned with project selection semantics

### Fixed

- 🐛 **Example cards link/clone regressions**
  - Fixed broken external open behavior from webview
  - Fixed clone failures caused by non-root repository URLs

- 🐛 **Incorrect state source for profile-based UX**
  - Profile context is derived from sidebar `WORKSPACES` selection (not recent-workspace clicks)

  - Sidebar Workspace button now navigates to Welcome Panel and opens Create Workspace modal
  - `WelcomePanel.openWorkspaceModal()` static method with `__workspace__` pending-modal token
  - `rapidkit.openWorkspaceModal` command registered in extension

- 🚫 **Modules Disabled for Go Projects**
  - Sidebar AVAILABLE MODULES shows info banner instead of module list when Go project selected
  - Welcome Page ModuleBrowser renders Go-specific banner; search/filters hidden
  - `ModuleExplorerProvider.setProjectPath(path, type?)` accepts optional project type
  - `ModuleBrowser` accepts `modulesDisabled` prop

### Fixed

- 🔧 **Go Project Init Detection**
  - `rapidkit.projectDev` now checks `go.sum` (not `node_modules`) for Go projects
  - Default port for Go projects set to `3000`; uses `npx rapidkit dev` instead of `npm run start:dev`

- 🔧 **openWorkspaceModal Wrong State**
