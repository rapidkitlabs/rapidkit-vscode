## 🐛 Bug Fixes

### NestJS Projects Not Showing in Explorer
**Fixed a critical issue where NestJS projects were invisible:**
- ✅ Fixed NestJS projects not appearing in the Projects view
- ✅ Project explorer now correctly detects both FastAPI and NestJS projects
- ✅ FastAPI projects detected via `pyproject.toml`
- ✅ NestJS projects detected via `package.json` with `@nestjs/core` dependency

**Root Cause:**
The project explorer was only looking for `pyproject.toml` files, which meant NestJS projects were completely ignored and not displayed in the sidebar.

**Solution:**
Enhanced project detection logic to check both Python and Node.js project markers:
- FastAPI: `pyproject.toml` file
- NestJS: `package.json` with `@nestjs/core` dependency

---

## 🔧 Improvements

### Simplified Kit Selection
- **Removed incomplete kits** from project creation wizard
- Only `standard` kit is now available for both FastAPI and NestJS
- Prevents users from selecting incomplete/experimental kits (advanced, ddd)
- Cleaner, more focused project creation experience

**Why?**
The `advanced` and `ddd` kits are not yet complete in the core RapidKit framework. Hiding them prevents confusion and ensures users only create projects with fully-supported configurations.

## 🔍 Technical Details

### Project Detection Logic
```typescript
// FastAPI: Check for pyproject.toml
if (await fs.pathExists(path.join(projectPath, 'pyproject.toml'))) {
  // FastAPI project detected
}

// NestJS: Check for package.json with @nestjs/core
if (await fs.pathExists(path.join(projectPath, 'package.json'))) {
  const pkg = await fs.readJSON(packageJsonPath);
  if (pkg.dependencies?.['@nestjs/core']) {
    // NestJS project detected
  }
}
```

### Available Kits
| Framework | Kit | Status |
|-----------|-----|--------|
| FastAPI   | `standard` | ✅ Available |
| FastAPI   | `ddd` | 🚧 Hidden (incomplete) |
| FastAPI   | `advanced` | 🚧 Hidden (incomplete) |
| NestJS    | `standard` | ✅ Available |
| NestJS    | `advanced` | 🚧 Hidden (incomplete) |
