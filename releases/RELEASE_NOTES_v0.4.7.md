## 🐛 Bug Fixes

### Missing Workspace Directory Handling

**Problem:**
Extension crashed with `ENOENT: no such file or directory` when trying to create projects in a workspace that was deleted or moved.

**Solution:**

- ✅ Detects when workspace directory no longer exists
- ✅ Shows helpful recovery dialog with 3 options:
  - **Recreate Workspace** - Creates the directory at original location
  - **Choose New Location** - Browse and select a new workspace folder
  - **Cancel** - Aborts the operation
- ✅ Automatically recreates workspace if user chooses to
- ✅ No need to restart VS Code after recovery

**Before v0.4.7:**

```
❌ Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, mkdir '/path/to/deleted/workspace/my-project'
```

**After v0.4.7:**

```
⚠️  Workspace directory no longer exists
[🔄 Recreate Workspace] [📁 Choose New Location] [❌ Cancel]
✅ Workspace recreated successfully!
```
