# Contributing to Workspai for VS Code

Thank you for helping improve Workspai. This repository owns the VS Code user
experience; the Workspai CLI remains the source of truth for commands,
contracts, artifacts, and Workspace Intelligence semantics.

## Before you start

- Use Node.js 20.19 or newer.
- Use the package manager declared by the repository through Corepack.
- Use VS Code 1.106 or newer for extension-host testing.
- Discuss broad product or contract changes before implementation.
- Never include secrets, private workspace evidence, or local absolute paths in
  fixtures, screenshots, logs, or pull requests.
- Use ASCII English for all authored source strings, tests, fixtures,
  documentation, release notes, and filenames. Language-neutral Unicode symbols
  and emoji are allowed; language text and accented letters are not.

## Set up the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/chistiq/rapidkit-vscode.git
cd rapidkit-vscode
corepack npm install
code .
```

Press `F5` to open an Extension Development Host. Use a disposable Workspai
workspace when testing create, adopt, import, repair, or mutation flows.

### Develop against an unpublished CLI

When the sibling Workspai CLI contains changes that are not on npm yet, activate
the explicit local candidate channel:

```bash
corepack npm run sync:cli-local -- --cli ../workspai/packages/cli
```

This command builds the CLI checkout, synchronizes its canonical contracts, and
creates an integrity-bound embedded runtime for the Extension Development Host.
Its machine-local receipt is git-ignored, and no local path is written to the
runtime manifest. Re-run the command after CLI source or contract changes.

```bash
corepack npm run check:cli-local -- --cli ../workspai/packages/cli
corepack npm run clear:cli-local
```

`clear:cli-local` restores the npm-pinned verified runtime. Release and VSIX
builds always ignore the local receipt, rebuild from the exact release-policy
version, require every mirrored contract to match that installed npm package,
and reject a `local-candidate` runtime during artifact inspection.
After the CLI is published, update the single release policy and run
`sync:cli-release-policy`; do not commit the local candidate receipt.

VSIX packaging has two explicit outputs:

```bash
corepack npm run package:release
corepack npm run package:local -- --cli ../workspai/packages/cli
corepack npm run package
```

`package:release` preserves the Marketplace filename and embeds only the
published CLI selected by release policy. `package:local` always rebuilds the
latest local checkout and writes a `-local-cli-<version>.vsix` artifact.
`package` always attempts both variants, release first and local second. Release
packaging temporarily projects contracts from the exact npm-pinned CLI and then
restores the development mirrors byte-for-byte before local packaging. A
failure in either channel does not prevent the other channel from being
attempted, but the command exits non-zero unless both artifacts pass. The local
artifact remains fully integrity-checked and path-clean, but the Marketplace
publish guard rejects it.

## Architecture boundaries

```text
Workspai CLI contracts and artifacts
                ↓
extension host services and command routing
                ↓
primary sidebar · Dashboard · Create · Assistant/Studio
```

- `contracts/` and `src/contracts/` mirror canonical CLI/extension contracts.
- `src/core/` owns host-side orchestration, evidence readers, AI routing, and
  safety boundaries.
- `src/ui/treeviews/` owns primary sidebar workspace/project navigation.
- `src/ui/panels/` and `src/ui/webviews/` own Dashboard and webview bridges.
- `webview-ui/src/` owns Dashboard and secondary-sidebar presentation.
- `src/test/` protects command parity, scope, contracts, and repair behavior.

Do not invent a second command, artifact, project taxonomy, or repair contract
inside the extension. Change the canonical CLI contract first, synchronize it,
then update the consuming UI and tests.

## Make a focused change

1. Create a branch:

   ```bash
   git switch -c feat/short-description
   ```

2. Keep workspace and project scope explicit in commands and messages.
3. Preserve missing/stale/blocked evidence instead of rendering it as success.
4. Add or update focused tests with every behavioral change.
5. Update user documentation only when the public workflow changes.

For Agent or Studio changes, preserve these boundaries:

- a command exit code is not proof that source changed;
- dependency edits are incomplete until lock/install and focused checks close;
- generated evidence is refreshed through CLI producers, never patched by the
  model;
- only fresh non-blocking verification can complete a repair;
- guarded, destructive, external, or ambiguous actions require explicit review.

## Validate

Run the checks relevant to your change, then the full release path when the
change affects shared contracts or user-facing behavior:

```bash
corepack npm run validate:contracts
corepack npm run check:english-text
corepack npm run check:local-paths
corepack npm run typecheck
corepack npm test
corepack npm run lint
corepack npm run build
```

Use `corepack npm run sync:shared-contracts` or
`corepack npm run sync:palette-surface` only when the canonical source changed;
review the generated diff before committing it.

The local-path guard scans staged content in `pre-commit`, the complete
repository in CI, and the packaged VSIX before publication. Use logical tokens
such as `$WORKSPACE`, `$PROJECT`, and `$HOME`; use `/opt/fixtures/...` only for
synthetic test paths. Do not add allowlist exceptions for developer-specific
directories.

The English-text guard follows the same boundary: pre-commit checks the exact
staged content, while lint, CI, VSIX packaging, and prepublication scan the
complete authored repository. Do not add exceptions for tests or historical
documents.

## Pull requests

Include:

- the user problem and intended outcome;
- affected workspace/project scope;
- contract or artifact changes;
- tests and commands run;
- screenshots or recordings for visible UI changes;
- compatibility, migration, and rollback notes when relevant.

Keep pull requests focused. Do not combine unrelated refactors, generated
artifacts, or formatting churn with a product change.

## Documentation

- [`README.md`](README.md) is the concise Marketplace story.
- [`docs/GETTING_STARTED.md`](docs/GETTING_STARTED.md) is the current user flow.
- [`docs/COMMAND_SURFACE_AUDIT.md`](docs/COMMAND_SURFACE_AUDIT.md) records
  extension/CLI command boundaries.
- [`RELEASE_NOTES.md`](RELEASE_NOTES.md) and `releases/` preserve version history.

Historical release documents may contain old product names and commands. Mark
archival files clearly; do not copy their instructions into current docs.
